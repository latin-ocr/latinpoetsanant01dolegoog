ΙΤ may be roughly stated that classic Roman literature
begins where classic Greek literature ended—with the
Drama. Yet this is only accidental and means little.
Plautus and Terence translated or imitated the plays 01
Menander, Philemon, and other masters of the so-called
new comedy3 and, the four great Greek dramatists who
bring an era to a close scarcely influenced the Roman
stage at all. Roman epic and Roman lyric alike copy
form and thought from the poets 01 Hellas. It is a com-
mon-place of criticism to declare that the Latius showed
110 originality in literature or art. But a great nation
must needs express its individuality; this 31111163, through

parts 111 Athenian streets, nevertheless were recognized
as Romans, uttering Roman sentiments. The whole
theatre burst into spontaneous applause at the senti·
ment, “I am a man3 naught that touches humanity is
alien to me.'' The famous passage which so touched the
heart of Octavia, on the death 01 the young MarceIIUS, ,
has also touched the heart 01 humanity‚ though the visit
01 AEneas to the unseeu realms was undoubtedly copied
from the visit of Odysseus to HadeS. The scholar may
detect the source 01 Horace's meti-es3 but Horace has
never lost and never will lose his place in the affec-
'tions 01 lovers 01 poetry. In fact, too much stress is laid
upon originality in our day. Plagiarism is the most
venial 01 vices. Mankind was furnished at the begin-
ning with a limited stock 01 ideas3 the greatest 01 poets
cannot find a new rime for love. If the Romans prided
themselves on being descended from the companions 01
AEneas‚ if the Roman poets never worked themselves
free from the influence of Greece, they certainly created
