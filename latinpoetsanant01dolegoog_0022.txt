Whether deservedly or not, the Latin language has
been familiar to vastly more men and women than has
the Greek. Until within a comparatively short time it
was the language of polite and diplomatic communication
among scholars 3011 nations. Poland and Rome were thus

 

united, while Russia stood aloof from Europe. It is in· .

deed a wonderful language. What other unless 31188130,-
which with its difficult alphabet and its sibilant syllables
is nevertheless a wonderfully satisfactory medium of
thought—can equal the Latin for 00001800088, for accuracy
of thought, for apt symmetry of expression, for delicacy
of harmon'y, for grace of rhythm? What sonorous ful-
ness of voweIS, what strength of varying consonant, how
musical, even when pronounced after the barbarous old
habit of giving the vowels the English sound! One
may prefer Greek3 but the fact remains that Latin is
far nearer to us and is acquired with much less effort.
Our English tongue looks back to Latin as its mother.

It is a quite common accomplishment among English
and European scholars to be able to turn a Latin verse.
Gladstone and many other English statesmen have pub-
lished their Latin translations. Th'e speeches of the
great orators of modern times are studded with citations
from Vergil and Horace and Ovid. Most of the great
poets of the English-speaking race have taken pride in
rendering into English verse their favourite selections from
the poets of Rome. It may 00 safely said that practically

all of classic literature exists in the vernacular. With .'

the exception of Vergil and Horace, however, the Roman
poets have not fared so well as have the Greek poets at
the hands of translators. There are no complete metrical
translations of Plautus and Terence later than the begin-
ning of the last century. Many charming passages from
Ovid and Lucretius must be presented in the stiff iambics
of the Pope and Dryden school, where the fair· woman
