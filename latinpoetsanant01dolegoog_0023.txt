Some of the old translationS, especially when given
in their quaint spelling and capitalization, are rather
effective. Marlowe, as might be expected from his rich-
ness of diction, turned Ovid’s elegies into clever English
verse. Marlowe was a poet3 not so much 0311 be said of
Sir Richard Burton, whose version of Catullus, however

, literal, is often amusing from its hopeless floundering.

It is unfortunate that scholarship is so rarely found in
combination with true poetic ’861186 31111 technique. In
this respect, Horace has suffered severely3 at the same
time 110 other poet of antiquity has had so many devotees
of first-class ability from Milton to Austin Dobson. One
could probably present a different translator for every
one of his songs. He more than any other tempts to
skill. How, then, shall he be translated: quantitatively
or in the varying rhythms of modern verse? Milton's
attempt at reproducing the metre of the original of the
“ Pyrrha '² ode cannot be said to be ‚very successful, as
far as English poetry is concerned3 nor did Lord Lytton
succeed much better. On the other hand, the rondeaux
and villanelles into which Mr. Dobson has so deftly

¹ transformed them 316 somewhat alien to English verse

and hardly dignified enough for Horace, wh0, in spite
of his gay epicureanism, was nevertheless a Roman and
conscious of his state as such.

Virgil, or Vergil, as modern scholars have deemed it
right to spell his name, has fared remarkably well Our
day cares little for the painfully prim and proper couplets
of Dryden with their tiresome iteiation of faulty rimes

the lines into a sort of mediaeval diction which some like
and some detest. The translation of Baron Bowen into
hexameters ending in rimed masculine syllables marks a
very great advance in the problem 'of a satisfactory form
of representing the original. The flexibility of his lines
is remarkable. The most successful attempt to represent
