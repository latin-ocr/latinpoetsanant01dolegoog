xiv INTRODUCTION.

1902 by Mr. Harlan Hoge Ballard, the founder of the
Agassiz Association. Mr. Ballard's version follows the
original line for line and shows a marvellous skill in
adaptation3 in fact, the lines read as spontaneously as
do more obvious forms of English verse. Through Mr.
Ballard's courtesy, a large part of the Sixth Book has
been placed in close proximity with the selection from
Lord Bowen's version, forming a most interesting study
in comparison. The cleverest translations from Martial
accompany an article by Miss Harriet W. Preston in the
“ Library of the World’s Best Literature.'' Although a
fifth part, at least, of Martial's satiric epigrams are unfit
for English readerS, the remaining parts are full of keen
wit and throw a bright light on Roman manners and
customs. · ,

The Latins showed more originality in their satires than
in their dramas or epics. This form of poetry grew up
out of the so-called Fescennine and Saturnine verseS, which
were often improvised, and were characterized by jocose ,
and rough humour, attacking vices and those that practised
vices. F escennia was in Etruria, and the rivalries in pro-
ducingthese poenis gave a great impetus to the spirit
of satire. Even Augustus the Emperor did not scorn to
make them. When 110 directed one* against the poet
Pollio, Pollio refrained from replying. The Emperor
asked him why. His answer was a pun which cannot
be reproduced in English: “It were better not to write
against one who might proscribe„ The satiric spirit
is discoverable in the extant plays3 it grows clearer and
keener and culminates in Juvenal. Α

Early Latin literature, indigenous to the soil, is entirely
lacking. It is known that there were historic ballads‚ prob-
ably written in a rough and inartistic style. Macaulay‚ in
his ‘'‘ Lays of Ancient Rome,'' tried to give English readers
an idea of what they might have been. Livius Adronicus
is the first, but only a name, who emerges from the dark-
ness of Italian antiquity3 even he was a Greek, and the
titles of his foui-teen plays—comedies and tragedies—
show that they were either translated or imitated from
the writers of his native land. He also wrote a sort of epic
poem on the fortunes of Ulysses in the ancient⁴ Saturnine
metre. All his works are lost. Cnaeus Naevius was another
of the ancient Roman poetS, known only through titles or
