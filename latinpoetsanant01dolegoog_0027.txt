THE LATIN POETS.

——o-ossoeoo—

TITUS MAOOIUS PLAUTUS.

Prima-ns, the earliest and by many considered the
greatest of the Roman comedy writers, was born about
the middle of the third century before Christ in an ob-
scure village of Umbria near the head-waters of the
Sapis (now the Savio) River under the shadow of the
Apennines. He somehow managed to pick up a thorough
knowledge of Greek3 but when he arrived at Rome,
he was in such straitened circumstances that he served
as a menial for the actors. The money that he thus
earned he put into some commercia] undertaking which
proved disastrouS. He obtained work in turning a hand-
mill for a baker. While thus employed he composed two
or three of his earliest plays, and from this time— 224
B. c. —he enjoyed uninterrupted popularity for forty years.
He copied the Greek comedies of Menander, who had
died about thirty· seven years before he was born, and
other writers of the Middle Comedy, depicting the scenes
of everyday life, but though the characters were Greek,
and the soenes laid in Athens, the colouring was local, and
the action, speech, and allusions were comprehensible to
the Romans. It was said of him by several Roman
authors that the Muses would use the language of Plautus
were they to speak Latin. Although he sometimes in-
troduces archaic expression8‚ still Aulus Gellius praises
him as‘ ‘the chief in elegance'' among those that write
the Latin tongue. He evidently realized his own impor-
tance if the epitaph which has come down to us is
genuine:—

“Postquam est ‘mortem aptus PlautuS, commoedia luyet
scena deserta, dein risus ludus iocusque
et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt; ’²
