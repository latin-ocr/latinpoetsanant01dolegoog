2 TITUS MAGGIUS PLA UTUS.

which has been thus translated: -

“ Wit, Laughter, «leste, and all the train that use
To adorn the scene and grace the Comic Muse,
Forsook the stage, at Plautus' death to mourn‚
And Harmony‚ undone‚ sat weeping o’er his urn.”

Plautus died in 184 13.c., leaving to the Roman stage
a legacy of plays which with counterfeits amounted to
one hundred and thirty in number. Varro, the most
learned and voluminous of the Roman writers, critically
examined these comedies, and came to the conclusion that
only twenty-one of them were genuine. All but one of
these have come down to our day, though some of them
are badly mutilated and corrupted. Moliere, Dryden,
Regnard, Addison, Shakespeare, and many other modern
playwrights have imitated many passages and whole
soenes or situations from these ancient dramas.

‘ ‘ AMPm'rRYoN. ”

Amphitryon [alone] What shall Ι do, abandoned by

my friendS, -

And now without an advocate to help me ’.Ρ -

Yet shall 116 ne'er abuse me unrevenged,

Whoe'er he is 1 -Ι 'll straight unto the king,

And lay the whole before him. ——I 'll have vengeance

On this damned sorcerer, who has strangely turned

The minds of all our family. -But where is he ? —

Ι doubt not but he 's gone in to my wife! — '

Lives there in Thebes a greater wretch than Ι ? —-

What shall Ι do now, since all men deny me,

And fool me at their pleasure ’.Ρ-’Τ is resolved:

Ι 'll burst into the house and whomsoever

I set my eyes on, servant, male or female,

Wife or gallant, father 01· grandfather,

I 'll cut hem into pieces :—N or shall Jove

Nor all {he gods prevent it, if they would,

But I will do what Ι 've resolved. --Ι 'll in! ,
[As he advances toward the door, it thunders and he

falls down. Thunder and liqhtninq.
