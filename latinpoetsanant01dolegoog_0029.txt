THE BIRTH OF HERCULES. 3

Emer BRomA, ALcMENA's maid.

Bromia. I have no means 01 safety left3 my hopes
Lie in my breast extinct and buried3 Ι
Η616 lost all confidence of heart and spirit,
Since all things seem combined, sea, earth, and heaven,
To oppress and to destroy me. — I am wretched 1-
I know not what to d03 101 prodigies ‘
Have been displayed within. - Ah, woe is me!
Ι ’111 sick at heart now‚—would I had some water, —
I faint, my head aches l I don't hear, nor see
Well with my eyes. — Ah me! no woman 81116
Was e'er 80 wretched, an event 80 strange
Has happened to my mistress, — When she found
Herself in labour, she invoked the gods z —
Then what a rumbling, grumbling, flashing, clashing
Straightway ensued! Suddenly how quick‚
How terribly it thundered 1 All that stood .
Fell flat down at the noise: and then we heard
Some one, Ι know not wh0, with mighty voice
Cry out, “ Alcmena, succour is at hand:
Be not dismayed3 the heaven’ 8 high 111161 6011168
To you propitious and to 01118 1 Α1·186,
(Says he) ye who have f alyen through the terror
And dread 01 1116. ”-Ι 1086 110111 where I lay,
And such a brightness streamed throughout the 1101186,
Methought it was in flames. Then presently
Alcmena called and this afflicted me
With horror, 101· Ι 166166. 11111611 111016 101 1161
Τ11611 101 myself: Ι 1611 to her 111 haste,
Το know what she might want, and (bless my eyes 1)
Saw she had been delivered 01 two boys
Nor any 01 118 knew 01 did suspect
When she was thus delivered. —But what' 8 this?
Who 18 this old man, stretcht before our house?
Η68 116 been thunder- stricken ἱ) Ι believe 80.
For he 18 laid out as if dead31'll go
And learn who 't 18. [Advancinq to Amrmrrssvon] ’Τ 18
certainly Amphitryon,
My master. — Hc, Amphitryon.
Amphitryon. Ι 6111 dead.
Bromia. Come, 1186, 811.

. Amphitryon Ι ’111 quite dead,
