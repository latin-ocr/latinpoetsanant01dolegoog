,THE BJR ΤΗ oF HERCULEs. 5

Bromia. Meantime‚ while this was done, not one of us
Or heard your wife once groan or once complain.
She was delivered even without a pang.
Amphitryon. That joys me, Ι confeSS‚ however little
She merits at my hands.
Bromia. Leave that, and hear
What more Ι have to say. After delivery
She bade us wash ‘the boys: we set about it
But he that I washt‚ oh, how sturdy is he!
So strong and stout withal, not one of us
Could bind him in his swaddling clothes.
Amphitryon. 'T is wondrous
What you relate: if your account be true,
Ι doubt not but Alcmena has been favoured
With large assistance and support from heaven.
Bromia. You 'll say what follows is more wondrous still
After the boy was in his cradle laid,
Two monstrous serpents with high-lifted crests
Slid down the sky-light: in an instant both
Reared up their heads,
Amphitryon. Ah me!
Bromia. Be not dismayed.
The serpents cast their eyes around on all,
And after they had spied the children out,
With quickest motion made toward the cradle.
Ι, fearing for the boys and for myself,
Drew back the cradle‚ stirred it to and sm,
Backwards and forwards‚ on one side and t' other:
The more Ι workt it by so much the more
These serpents fierce pursued. That other boy
Soon as he spied the monsterS, in an instant
Leaps him from out the cradle‚ straight darts at them,
And suddenly he seizes upon both,
In each hand grasping one.
Amphitryon. The tale you tell
Is fraught with many wonders and the deed
That you relate is all too terrible3
For horror at your words creeps through my limbs 1-
What happened next ⁴? Proceed now in your story.
Brognia. The child killed both the serpents. During
t is
A loud voice calls upon your wife-—
Amphitvyon. Who calls ⁴?
