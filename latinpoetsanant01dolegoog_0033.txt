THE BRAGGART AND THE PARASITE. 7

Show me whoever can, a greater liar

One fuller of vain boasting than this fellow

And he shall have me, Ι 'll resign me up

ΤΟ be his slave, though when Ι ’111 mad with hunger,

He should allow me nothing else to eat

But whey and butter-milkl
Pyrqopozintces. Where art thou ⁴?
Artotroqua Here.

How in the name of wonder was 't you broke

In India with your fist an elephant's arm ?
Pyrqopolinicea How! arm ⁴?

Artotroqus. His thigh, Ι 11103111;.

Pyrqopolmices. I was but playing.

Artotroqua Had you put forth your strength, you
would have driven , ’

Your arm quite through his hide, boneS, guts and all.
Pyryopolinicea I would not talk of these things now.
Artotroyaa Indeed

You would but spend your breath in vain to tell

Your valorous feats to me, who know your proweSS.

[Asida] My appetite oreates me all this plague3

My ears must hear him or my teeth want work3

And Ι must swear to every lie he utterS.

Pyrqopozinices. Hold 1—- what was I about to say ⁶?
Artotroyus. I know
What you designed to say; a gallant action.
I well remember.
Pyrqcmozinices. What ?

Artotroqus. Whate'er it be.
Pyrqopolinices. Hast thou got tablets ⁶?
Artotroyus. Yes Ι have ; d' ye want them ? -

A penoil too,
Hsryopolinices. How rarely dost thou suit
Thy mind to mine 1
Artotroyua 'T is fit that Ι should study
Your inclinations and my oare should be
Even to forerun your wishes,
Pyryopolinicea What remember’st ?
Artotroqus, Ι (10 remember— let me 800 1 - 311 hundred
Syoolatronidans, and thirty Sardian8‚
And three-soore Macedoniam, — that 's the number
Of persons whom you slaughtered in one dayss
Pyrqopolinicea What ’8 the sum total of these men ?
