Artotroqus. Seven thousand.
Pyryopolinices. So much it should bel— Thou 'rt a
right accountant.

Artotroqu3. Ι have it not in writing, but remember.
Pyrqopolinice3. Thou hast an admirable meinory. ἲ
Ανῐοιᾙοραεε ’Τ is sharpened by my stomach.
Pyrqopolinices. Bear thyself

As thou hast hitherto and thou shalt eat

Eternally3 foi-ever shalt thou be

Partaker of my table!
Artotroqus. Then again

What feats did you perform in Cappadocia.

Where at one single stroke you had cut off

Five hundred men together, if your sword

Had not been blunt, and these but the remains

Of the infantry which you before had routed‚ —-

[Aside] If ever there were any such iu being!

Why should 1 tell you what all mortals know —

That Pyrgopolinices stands alone —

The only one on earth famed above men

For beauty‚ valour, and renowned exploits ?

. The ladies all of you enamoured are,

Nor without reason‚— since you are so handsome3
WVitness the gay young danisels yesterday,
That pluckt me by the coat.
Pyrqopolinices [3milinq]. What said they to you ⁴?
Artem-equa They questioned me about you — “ Is not
that '² -—
Says one of them— “Achilles ? '² — “Troth‚'' said Ι,
“ It is his brother '' -— “Why indeed, forsooth
He 's wondrous handsome‚'' quoth another: “ how
His hair becomes him 1— Oh, what happiness
Those ladies do enjoy who share his favourS. ''
Pyrqopolmicea Did she indeed say sc. 9
ArtotroquS. Two in particular
Begged of me I would bring you by their way
That they might see you march.
⁴ Pyrqopolz‘nice3. What plague it is
To be too handsome!
Artotroqus. They are so importunate
They 're ever begging for a sight of you.
They send for me so often to come to them,
I scarce have time to attend your business.
