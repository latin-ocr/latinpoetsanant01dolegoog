'A ROMAN GENTLEMAN. 11

Pleu-sides. Sir, your whole manners have a special grace ε
Show me but three men like you and I 'll forfeit
Their weight to you in gold.
Palaestrio. You shall not find
Another of his age that 's more accomplisht,
More thoroughly to his friends a friend.
Periplectomenes. 1 'll make you
Own in my manners Ι 'm a very youngster
1'11 show myself so ready to oblige.
Need you an advocate to enforoe your suit,
Rude and of fiery temper ? Ι am he.
Need you a mild and gentle ? You shall say
Ι 'm gentler than the sea, when it is husht‚
And softer than the Zephyr's balniy breeze.
A jovial buck am Ι, a first-rate wit,
And best of eaterers: then as for danoing,
No 'finioal slim fop ean equal me.
Palaestrio [to PLEUSIDES] Of all these excellent αα,
WhigfiruvffiffiigffitghoosQ were you to have the option ?
Pleusidea 1 would, at least, my poor thanks oould be
equal
To his deserts and yours3 for I have given you
A world of trouble. — But [to PERIPLEOTOMENES] it much
. oonoerns me,
The expense Ι put you t0.
Periplectomene& You are a fool 3—
Expense forsooth l—Upon an enemy,
Or a bad wife, whatever you lay out,
That is expense indeed. But on a friend,
Or a good guest, what you expend is gain:
As als0, what is eost in sacrificeS,
Is by the· wise and virtuous oounted profit. —
Blest be the godS, that courtesy Ι have
With hospitality to treat a stranger.
Eat, drink, and take your pleasure with me; load
Yourself with merriment3 my house is free,
Ι free, and Ι would have you use me freely. ·
For by the gods' kind favour I may say it
Ι from my fortune might have ta'en a wife
Of the best family and portioned too:
But Ι don't ohoose to bring into my house η
An everlasting barker.
