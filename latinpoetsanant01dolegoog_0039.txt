A ROMAN GENTLEMAN. 13

And to my heart's content. -— Upon my death

My fortune I 'll bequeath to my relatione,

Dividing it among them. —- They eat with me,

Make me their care, see what Ι have to dc,

Or what I want3 are with me before day,

To ask if I have slept well over night:

They are to me as children z they are ever

Sending me presents: when they sacrifice,

I have a larger portion than themselves:

They take to me the entrails 3 they invite me

To dine, to sup with them3 he counts himself

The most unfortunate that sends me least3

They vie with one another in their presents;

When to myself I whisper all the while

Ay, ay, it is my fortune they gape after,

And therefore strive they in their gifts to me.
Palaestrio, You see things with a clear discerniug

s irit.

Whilep you are well and hearty‚ we may say

You 've children thick and three-fold.
Periplectomene& Had Ι had

I should have had anxiety enough

On their account. Ι think Ι should have died

If son of mine had had a fall in liquor,

Or tumbled from his horse 3 so great had been

My dread that he had broke a leg at least

If not his neck. — And then my apprehensione

Lest that my wife should bring a monstrous brood‚

Deformed and markt, — some bandy-legged, knock-kneed,

Or shambling, squint-eyed, tusk-tootht brat or other.
Palaestrio. This gentleman desei-ves an ample fortune,

And to have life continued to him long3

For why ⁶? He keeps him within bounds‚ and yet

Lives well and is a pleasure to his friends.
Pleusicles. What a sweet fellow. — As I hope heaven's

love

'T were fit the gods should order and provide

That all men should not live alike‚

Squared by one rule: but as a price is fixt

On different wareS, that so they may be sold

According to their value3 that the bad

Its owner may impoverish by its vileness;

So it were just, the gods in human life
