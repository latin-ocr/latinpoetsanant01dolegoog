14 TITUS MA CCIUS PLA UTUS.

Should make distinction due and disproportion3

That on the well-disposed they should bestow

A long extent of years; the reprobate

And wicked they should soon deprive of life.

Were this provided, bad men would be fewer,

Less hardily they 'd aot their wicked deeds

Nor would‘there be a dearth of honest men.
Periplectomenes. Whoever blames the oounsels of the

gods

And finds fault with them is a fool and ignorant.

No more then of these matters. — Ι ’11 to market,

That Ι may entertain you as Ι ought,

And as you should be treated— with good oheer

And a kind, hearty weloome.
Pleu-sides. shall Ι then

Have no remorse in putting you to charge ?

Whene'er a man is quartered at a friend’S,

If he but stay three dayS, his company

They will grow weary of3 but if he tarry

Ten days together, though the master bear it,

The servants grumble. .
Penplectomenea Wherefore have Ι servants

But to perform me service, not that they

Should bear authority o'er me or hold me

Bounden to them ⁴? — If what Ι like they like not, .

I steer my own course 3 though 't is their aversion,

Still they must do 't or be it at their peril!
