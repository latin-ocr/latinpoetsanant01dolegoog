QUINTUS ENNIUS.

ENNIUS, whom Horace called “ the second Homer '' and
Cicero hailed a's Rome's loftiest poet, was of Greek
origin and was born at Rudiae in Calabria, in 239 uc.
Being a Roman subject, he served in the army of Titus
Manlius in the war waged in Sardinia against the allies
of Carthage. In 204 the elder Cato brought him to
Rome. Fisteen years later he accompanied Marcus Ful-
vius Nobilior throughout his campaign in AEtolia and on
his return made a respectable living by teaching the sons
of Roman patricians the Greek language. He lived on
terms of intimacy with the great men of his day, Scipio
Africanus being his warmest friend. He was granted
the freedom of the city, and when he died, in 169, at the
age of seventy, his bust was placed in th’e tomb of the
Scipios. It is now supposed to be at the Vatican.
He wrote an epic poem in eighteen books, giving the
annals of Rome from the prehistoric times of the loves
of Mars and Rhea, and continued till his own day. He
translated a great number of tragedies, wrote a few com-
edies and various other poem8‚ but only a few meagre
fragments remain. His versification was rather crude
and rough, but vigorous.

THE ROMAN TRIBUNE IN BATTLE.

Fon'rn on the tribune, like a shower, the gathering jave-
His bliildklsgnplii'rce—-or on its boss the quivering lances
Or ιζέῒιῑῙΙΞ-οῖι his brazen he1m3 but vain the utmost might
Of foes that press on every side, -none can the tribune
And ειιῐιῐιὲιῂιῗγ a spear he shivers then and many a stroke
Whileesviffilis many a jet of reeking sweat his labouring

body flows. 15
