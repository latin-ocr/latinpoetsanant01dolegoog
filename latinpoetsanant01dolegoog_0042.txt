16 QUINTUS ENNIUS.

No breathing time the tribune has—no pause—the
winged iron,

The Isti-ian dartS, 111 ceaseless showers‚ provoke him and

And essxgggnand sling destruction bring on many 1131033

whosfflffle headlong from the w211‚withinit or without.

SOOTHSAYERS.

Fon 110 Μ3131311 augur (whom fools view with awe)‚

Nor diviner nor star· -gazer care I a straw3

The Egyptian quack‚ an expounder of (11331113,

13 neither 1n science nor art what he seems3

Superstitious and 311311131333, they prowl through our
st1·‚eets

Some hungry, some crazy, but all of them cheats.

Impostors‚ who vaunt that to others they '11 show

A path which themselves neither travel nor know.

Since they romise us wealth if we pay for their pains

Let them ta e from that wealth and bestow what remains

ABE THERE GODS. 9

YEs! there are gods; but they no thought bestow
On human deeds, on mortal bliss or woe3
Else would such ills our wretched 1303 333311 ?

Would the Good suffer ’.Ρ —would the Bad prevail ⁴?

——Translation os Joim Coun Dmuor.

 

EVENING CALM.

'run heaven’s vast world stood silent3 Neptune gave
A hushful pause to Ocean's roughening wave3

The Suu curbed his swift steeds3 the eterna] floods
Stood still3 and not a breath was on the woods.
