PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER.

TERENGE was born in Carthage in 195 B.c. In some
way he was brought to Rome and became the slave of a
senator named Publius Terentius Lucanus, who gave him
the best possible education, and ultimately his freedom and
name. Suetonius says: “He wrote six comedieS. When
he offered his first play, which was the ‘ Andrian,' to the
AEdiles, he was ordered to read it to Caecilius. When he
arrived at that poet's house he found him at table, audit
is said that our author, being very meanly dressed, was
suffered to read the opening of his play, seated on a very·
low stool, near the couch of Caecilius; but scarcely had
he repeated a few lines, when Caecilius invited him to
sit down to supper with him 3 after which Terence
proceeded with his play and finished it to the no small
admiration of Caecilius.'' Caecilius died in 168 and it
was two years before the “Andria '' was put on the stage,
scitis possible this is a fable. In spite of much envy
on the part of other play-writers, his first comedy was
successful. Terence was distinguished for his good looks
and his elegant mannerS, and he was at once received into
the most exclusive circleS. His chief friends and pati-ons

were Laelius and the younger Scipio. It was openly as· ·

εὓθτῖθό.ι that Scipio Africanus wrote the plays for his own
amusement and allowed Terence to have the credit. The
Bacon-Shakespeare controversy was thus anticipated.

“ Eunuchus '² was the most popular of the six. comedies 3
it was acted twice in one day and brought its author
eight thousand 'sesterceS, a sum equivalent to about three
hundred dollars, though perhaps more in purchasing power.
Madame Dacier thus compares the plays: “ Each of them
has its peculiar beauty. The ‘ Andr-ian ² and ‘Brothers ²
seem to excel in beauty of character 3 the ‘ Eunuch ' and
‘Phormio ' in the vivacity of intrigue3 and the “ Self-
tormenter' and ‘ Stepmother' have, in my mind, the ad-
vantage in sentiment and lively painting of the passions
and in the purity and delicacy of style.''
