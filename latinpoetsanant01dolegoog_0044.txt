18 PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER.

After having produced the six plays now known to
uS, all of which are more or less accurate translations
from the Greek, Terence left Rome for Greece‚ Some
say that he died at sea on his return from Athens whence
he was bringing back one hundred and eight plays; others
that he died in Greece3 and still others that his death
was caused by grief at having lost all his plays, original 0
as well as translated. Suetonius cites very cruel lines
by Porcius Licinus which attributed to the poet grave
'immoralities They end ε -

“ Το depth of poverty he was reduced,
Wherefore from sight of all he went away
Into the farthest parts of Greece‚

And died at Stymphalus in Arcadia.”

, Suetonius declares that he left a daughter who married

a Roman knight and that he possessed a house and a
six-acre garden on the Appian Way. Christian August
Crusius thus compares Plautus and Terence ε -

“Plautus is gayer3 Terence is chaster. The first has
more genius and fire3 the latter more manners and solid-
ity. Plautus excels in⁴low comedy and ridicule3 Ter-
ence in drawing just characters and maintaining them to
the last. The plots of both are artful, but Terence's are
more likely to languish‚ while Plautus' spirit maintains
the action with vigour. His invention was greatest3
Terence's art and management. Plautus gives the
stronger3 Terence a more elegant delight. Plautus ap-
pears the better comedian of the th as Terence the
finer poet. The former has inore compass and variety3
the latter more regularity and truth in his characters.
Plautus shone most on the stage3 Terence pleases best
in the closet. Men of refined taste would prefer Terence3
Plautus divided both patrician and plebian.'' As both
of them translated their plays from the same Greek
author this is equivalent to saying Plautus better repre-
sented the Roman life of his day, since he injected far
’ more originality. Terence translated; Plautus adapted
and paraphrased.

Cicero the orator, who imagined that he was also a
poet, spoke of Terence in labouring hexameter-s as being
the only one who could transfer the Attio graces of
Menander into the Latin tongue with such purity and
