· 20 PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER.

Supposititious children, bubbled dotardS,

Or love, or hate, or jealousy ? — In short,

Nothing 's said now, but has been said before!
Weigh 111011 111080 things with candour and forgive
The Modern, if what Ancients did they do!

—- Translation os GEORGE Commu.

 

ORIGINALITY IN REVAMPING.

As to report which envious men have spread
That 110 1138 ransackt many Grecian playS,
While he composes some few Latin ones,—
That he denies not 110 1138 done; nor does
Repent he did it3 means to do it still;

Safe in the warrant and authority

Of great bards who did long since do the same.
Then for the charge 111311118 arch-enemy
Maliciously reproaches him witha13 ,

Τ1131 110 11111 lately 113111 applied himself

To music, with the genius of his friendS,

Rather 111311 natural talents fraught3 how true
Your judgment, your opinion, must decide!

Ι would 01111031 you therefore not to lean

To tales of slander rather 111311 01 candour.

Be favourable3 nurse with growing hopes

The bards who give you pleasing novelties;
Pleasing Ι say, 1101 811011 38 1118 Ι 1110311,

Who lately introduced a breathless slave
Making the crowd give way : — But wherefore 11300
Α (1111100’8 1311118 ? which shall be shown at large,
When more he writeS, unless he cease 10 1311.

Attend impartially! and let me 01100
Without annoyance act an easy part3
Lest your old servant be o'erlaboured still
With toilsome characters — the running slave,
The eating parasite, enraged old man,

The bold-faced sharper, covetous procurer3
Parts that ask powers of voice and iron sides,

Deign then, for my sake, to accept this plea,

And grant me some remission from my labourz

For they who now produce new comedies
