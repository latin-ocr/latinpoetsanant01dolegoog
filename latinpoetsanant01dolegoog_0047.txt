A MODEL SON. 21

Spare not my age: if there is aught laborious
They run to me3 but if of little weight-
Away to others! In our piece to-day
The style is pure: now try my talents then
In either character. If Ι for gain
Never o'errated my abilities3
If Ι have held it still my chief reward
To be subservient to your pleasure3 fix
In me a fair example, that our youth
, May seek to please you, rather than themselves.

—- Translation os Gssonon CotuAu.

A MODEL SON.

“ Tun Aunnuu.”

Simo [to servants] Carry those things in; go,
Sosia, come here3 a word with you.
Sosia [Smo'sfreedman]. I understand5 that these be
ta'en due care of.
Simo. Quite another thing.
Sosia. What can my art do for you ’.Ρ
Simo This business
Needs not that art3 but those good qualitieS,
Which Ι have ever known abide in you,
Fidelity and secrecy.
Sosia. I wait your pleasure.
Simo. Since I bought yon, from a boy,
How just and mild a servitude you 've past
With me, you 're conscious. From a purchased slave
I made you free, because you served me freely3
The greatest recompense I could bestow.
Sosia. Ι do remember.
Simo. Nor do Ι repent.
Sosia. If I have ever done or now do aught
That 's pleasing to you, Simo, I am glad
And thankful that you hold my service good.
And yet this troubles me: for this detail,
Forcing your kindness on my memory‚
Seems to reproach me of ingratitude.
