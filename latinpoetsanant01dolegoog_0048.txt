22 PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER.

Simo. Ι will: and this I must advise you first:
The nuptial you suppose preparing now
Is all unreal.

Sosia. Why pretend it then ?
¹ Simo, You shall hear all from first to last3 and thus

The conduct of my son, my own intent,

And what part you ’re to aet, you 'll know at once.
For my son, Sosia, now to manhood grown,

Had freer scope of living: for before

How might you know, or how indeed divine

His disposition, good or ill, while youth,

Fear, and a master, all constrained him?

Sosia. True!

Simo, Though most, as is the bent of youth, apply
Their mind to some one objeet— horses, houndS,
Or to the study of philosophy,

Yet none of these, beyond the rest, did he
Pursue3 and yet, in moderation, al’l.
I was o '·e1joyed.

Sosia. And not without good cause.
For this I hold to be the Golden Rule'

Of life: Too much of one thing 's good for nothing!

Simo. So did he shape his life to bear himself
With ease and frank good humour unto all;

Mixt in what company soe'er, to them

He wholly did resign himself3 eomplied
With all their humours, oheeking nobody,
Nor e’er assuming to himself z and thus

With ease, and free from envy, may you·gain
Praise, and conciliate friendS.

Sosia. He ruled his life
By prudent maxims: for, as times go now,
Complianee raises friends and truth breeds hate!

Simo. Meanwhile ('t is now about three years ago)
A certain woman from the isle of Andros,

Came o'er to settle in this neighbourhood,
By poverty and oruel kindred driven3
Handsome and young.

Sosia. Ah! Ι begin to fear
Some misohief from this Andrian.

Simo. At first
Modest and thriftily, though poor, she lived, ’
With her own hands a homely livelihood
