A MODEL SON.

Scarce earning from the distaff and the loom.
But when a lover came with proffered gold,
Another and another3 as the mind
Falls easily from labour to delight,
She took their offers and set up the trade.
They who were then her chief gallantS‚ by chance
Drew thither, as oft happens with young men,
My son to join their company. ‘⁴ So, so !'’
(Said Ι within myself) ‘⁴ he 's smit! he has it! ”
And in the mornmg as Ι saw their servants
Run to and fr0‚ Ι 'd often call, ‘⁴ Here, boy.
Prithee now, who had Chrysis yesterday ’.Ρ ” -
The name of this same Andrian.
Sosia. Ι take you!
Simo, Phaedrus, they 'd say, Clinia, or Niceratus;
For all these three then followed her. — “ well, well,
But what of Pamphilus ἱ) ” - “ Of Pamphilus ἱ)
He supt, and paid his reckoning.'' -Ι was glad.
Another day Ι made the like inquiry,
But still found nothing touching Pamphilus.
Thus I believed his virtue proved and hence
Thought him a miracle of continence;
For he who struggles with such spirits, yet
Holds in that commerce an unshaken mind,
May well be trusted with the governance
Of his own conduct! Nor was Ι alone
Delighted with his life, but all the world
With one accord said all good things and praised
My happy fortunes, who possest a son
So good, so liberally disposed. —In short
Chremes, seduced by this fine character,
Came of his own accord, to offer me
His only daughter with a handsome portion
In marriage with my son. I liked the match:
Betrothed my son: and this was pitcht upon
By joint agreement, for the wedding-day.
Sosia. ,And what prevents its being so ?

Simo. Ι 'll tell you

In a few dayS, the treaty still on foot,

This neighbour Chrysis dies.
Sosia. In happy hour.
Happy for you. I was afraid of Chrysis!
Simo. My son, on this event, was often there
