26 PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER.

Ι catch him at his trieks 1—- But what need words ?
If as I wish it may, it should appear
That Pamphilus objeets not to the match,
Chremes remains to be prevailed upon,
And will, I hope, consent. 'T is now your place
To counterfeit these nuptials eunningly,
To frighten Davus, and observe my son,
What he 's about, what plots they hatoh together.
Sosia. Enough! I ’11 take due care. Let 's now go in!

Simo. As if 't were possible to utter aught
Severer than he merits! Tell me, then, [to PAMPHILUS]

Pamphilus. They say so!
Simo. They say 801- 011, amazing impudenee!—-

Repent the deed. ‘⁷ or does his eolour take
The hue of shame ? ——To be so weak of soul,
Against the eustom of our citizenS,
Against the law, against his father's will,
To> wed himself to shame and this vile woman!
Pamphilus. Wreteh that I am!
Simo. Ah, Pamphilus, d’ ye feel
Your wretchedness at last? Then, then, when first
You wrought upon your mind. at any rate
To gratis y your passion· from that hour
