A HAPPY RECONC'ILIA TION. 29

Bear your missortunes patiently! For me,

If I speak true or false, shall now be known.

—A man 01 Athens once upon a time

Was shipwreokt on the coast 01 Andros ε with him
This very woman, then an infant. He

In this distress applied, it so 1011 out,

For help to Chrysis' father—-

Simo. All romanoe!

Chremes. Let him alone l⁴

Orico. And will he interrupt me ⁴?
Chremes. Go on 1

Crito. Now Chrysis' father, who received him,

Was my relation. There I 've often heard
The man himself deelare he was 01 Athens

There too he died.
Chremes. His name ?

Simo. His name so quiekly ’.Ρ
Crito. Phania.

Chremes. Amazement.

Orico. Troth, I think 't was Phania.

But this I 'm sure, he said he was 01 RhamnOS.

Chremes. Oh, Jupiter Ξ

Crito. These circumstanoeS, ChremeS,
Were known to many others, then in Andros.

Chreme-9. Heaven grant it may be as Ι wish ! Inform me
Whose daughter, said he, was the child ⁴? His own ⁴?

Crito, No, not his own.

Chremes· 'Whose then ’ἲ
Crito, His brother's daughter.
Chremes. Mine, mine undoubtedly.
Crito. What say you ’.Ρ

» Simo. How ἶ)
Pamphilus, Hark, Pamphilus! -
Simo. But why believe you this ?
Chremes. That Phania was my brother.
Simo. True‚ I knew him.

Chreme& He, to avoid the war, departed 110110ος
And fearing 't were unsafe to leave the child,
Embarkt with her in quest of me to Asia:
Since when I 've heard no news 01 him till now.
Pamphilae. Ι 'm searoe myself, my mind is so enrapt
With sear, hope, joy, and wonder of so great,
So sudden happinesa
