THE PARASITE ΛΝΒ BOASTFUL CAPTAIN. 31

THE PARASITE AN D THE BOASTFUL CAPTAIN.

“ Tun Eunoen.”

Gnatho. Good Heaven8‚ how much one man excels
another!

What difference ’tw-ixt a wise man and a fool!
What just now happened proves it: coming hither
I met with an old countryman —a man
Of my own place and order, like myself
No scurvy fellow3 who, like me, had spent
In mirth and jollity his whole estate.
Seeing him in a wretched trim, his looks
Lean, sick, and dirty, and his clothes all ragS,
“ How now,·'’ cried Ι, “ what means this figure, Friend ? ''
“ Alas,'' says he, “my patrimony’s gone!
Ah, how am Ι reduced! My old acquaintance
And friends all shun me.'' —Hearing this, how cheap
I held him in comparison with me.
“ Why, how now, wretch ! ’' said I, “ most idle wretch·
Have you spent all, nor left even hope behind ?
What! have youlost your sense with your estate ?
Me !—look on me —come from the same condition!
How sleek! how neat! how clad! in what good case!
Ι 've everything, though nothing3 naught possessi,
Yet naught Ι ever want.'’ — “ Ah, sir, but Ι
Have an unhappy temper and can't bear
To be the butt of others, or to take
A beating now and then l '' — How then! d' ye think
Those are the means of thriving ? No, my friend.
Such formerly indeed might drive a trade ;
But mine 's a new profession3 I the first
That ever struck into this road. There are
A kind of men who wish to be the head
Of everything, but are not. These 1 follow
Not for their sport and laughter, but for gain,
To laugh with them and wonder at their parts:
Whate'er they say, I praise it3 if again
They contradict, Ι praise that too: Does any
Deny ? Ι too deny: Affirm ? I too
Affirm3 and, in a word, Ι 've brought myself
To say, unsay, swear, and unswear at pleasure!
