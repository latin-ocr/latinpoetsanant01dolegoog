32 PUBLIUS TERENTIUS AFER. ἣ

And that is now the best of all professione. . . .
Deep in this conversation, we at length
Come to the market, where the several tradesmen,
ButcherS, cookS‚ grocers, poulterers‚ fishmongers
(Who, while my means were ample, profited,
And though now wasted, profit by me still),
All run with joy to me, salute, invite,
And bid me welcomel He, poor half-starved wretch,
Soon as he saw me thus carest, and found
I got my bread so easily, desired
He might have leave to learn that art of me.
I bade him follow me, if possible.
And as the Schools of the Philosophers
Have ta'en from the philosophers their names,
So in like manner, let all parasites
Be called from me GnathonickS. . . .
Tho-asc. It is, indeed, something, 1 know not how,
Peculiar to me 3 do whate'er Ι please,
It will appear agreeable.

Gnatho. In truth
I always have observed it!
Thrace. ’ Even the king

Held himself much obliged, whate'er I did:
Not so to othere.

Gnatho. Men of wit like you,
The glory, got by others' care and toil,
Often transfer unto themselves!

ΊἸιναθο. You ’ve hit it!

Gnatho. The king then held you—-

ThrasO. ⁴ Certainly —

GnathO. Most dear —

sl'lzrasa Most near. He trusted his whole army to me,
His councils ——
Gnatho. Wonderful.
ΤῘιναεο. And then, whene’er
Satiety of company, or hate
Of business seized him —when he would repose—
Gnatho. Perfectly!
When he would— in a manner -—- clear his stomach
Of all uneasiness!
Gnatho, . The very thing!
On such occasions he chose none but me.
Gnatho. Hui! there 's 3 king indeed! a king of taste.
