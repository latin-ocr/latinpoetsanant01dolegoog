THE PARASITE' AND BOASTFUL CAPTAIN. 33

ΤῙιναεο. No general man, Ι promise you!
GnathO. Oh, no! ·
He must have been particular indeed,
If he conversed with you.
Thraso. The courtiers all
Began to envy me and railed in secret3
I cared not3 whence their spleen increased the more.
One in particular, who had the charge
Of the 'elephants from India, grew at last
So very troublesome; “ I prithee, Strato, ·
Are you so savage and so fierce,'’ said I,
“ Because you 're governor of the wild beasts ? '’
Gnatho Oh, finely said! - and shrewdly excellent 1-
Too hard upon him ! —- what said he to 't ⁴?
Thraso, Nothing!
Gnatho. And how the devil should he ⁶?
Thraso. Ay! but the story of the Rhodian, Gnatho,
How smart I was upon him at a feast— '
Did Ι ne'er tell you ’.Ρ
Gnatho. Never! but pray do!
[Asida] Ι 've heard it o’er and o'er a thousand times,
Thraso, We were by chance together at a feast -
This Rhodian that I told you of and I —-
I, as it happened, had a wench: the spark
Began to toy with her and laugh at me.
“ Why, how now, Impudence,'' said I, “are you
A hare. yourself, and yet would hunt for qame 2²⁹
Gnatho, Ha! ha! ha!
Witty ! smart! incomparable!
Is it your own ⁴? I swear I thought 't was old.
Thraso, Why, did you ever hear it ⁶?
Gnatho. Very often
And reckoned admirable.
Thraso. 'T is my own!
Gnatho. And yet 't was pity to be so severe
On a young fellow and a gentleman. . . .
What became of him ⁶?
Thraso, It did for him. The company were all
Ready to die with laughing !—In a word.
They dreaded me.
Gnatho, No wonder! ·
