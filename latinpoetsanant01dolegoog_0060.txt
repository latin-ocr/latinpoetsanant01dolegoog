HAPPINESS

“THE SELF-TORMENTOR.”

, Clitipho, They say that he is miserable.
Chremes Miserable ?

Who needs be less so? For what earthly good
Can man possess which he may not enjoy. 9
ParentS, a prosperous country, friends, birth, 1101108,
Yet all 'these take their value from the mind
01 the possessor: He that knows their use,
To him they' re blessings3 he that knows 11. not,
To him misuse eonverts them into eurses.

— Translacz'on os GEORGE Commu.

 

WIVES AND MISTRESSES„

“ Tm: STEPMOTHER. '’

Bacchis, Well, I commend you, my Antiphi1a3
Happy m having made 11, still your care
That virtue should seem fair as beauty in you.
Nor, graeious Heaven so help me, do I wonder
If every 111311 should wish you 101· 1118 own3
For your discourse bespeaks a worthy mind,
And when I ponder with myself and weigh .
You'r course 01 1110 and all the 10813ιο1 those
Who live not on the common, 't is 1101, strange .
Your 11101318 should be different from ours!
