No HOPE; No DISAPPOINTMENT. 35

Virtue 's your interest, those with whom we deal

Forbid it to be ours; for our gallantS,

Charmed by our beauty, court us but for that,

Which, fading‚ they transfer their love to others.

If then meanwhile we look not to 0111801νο8,

We live forlorn, deserted and distrest.

You, when you 've once agreed to pass your life

Bound to one man, whose temper suits with yours

He too attaches his whole heart to you:

Thus mutual friendship draws you each to each;

Nothing can part you, nothing shake your love.
Antiphila. I know not 0111018, for myself I know

From his content I ever drew my own.

WOMEN.

“ Trm STEPMOTHER.’'

011, Heaven and earth, what animals are women!
What 0 conspiracy among them all

To do or not to do, to hate or love alike!

No one but has the sex 80 strong in her,

She differs nothing from the rest. Stepmothers
All hate their ste'pdaug hters3 and every wife
Studies alike to contradict her husband,

The same perverseness running through them all.
Each seems trained up in the same school of mischief3
, And of that school, if any such there be,

My wife I think is schoolmistress.

— Translation os GEORGE Commu.

 

No HOPE; No DrsAPPOINTMENT.

Demipho. Ι know not what to do.
This stroke has come so unawares upon me,
Beyond all expectation, past belief!
