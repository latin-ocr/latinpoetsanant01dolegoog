THE CONTRADIOTIONS OF LIFE. 37

In practice he threw by! The very thing
That happens to myself. For that hard life
Which Ι have ever led, my raoe near run,

Now in the last stage, I renounee —and why ⁸?
But that by dear experienoe I 've been told
There 's nothing so advantages a man,

As mildness and. complaceney. Of this

My brother and myself are living proofs l

He always led an easy, eheerful life.

Good- 11111110111·,θ(1 mi1d‚offending nobody,
Smiling on all— a jovial baehelor,

His whole expenses centred 1n himself.

’ Ι, on the contrary, rough, rigid, erOSS,

Saving, morose, and thrifty, took a wife·

What miseries 'did marriage bring!— had children3
A new une'asinesS. — And then besideS,
Striving all ways to make a fortune for them,
I have worn out my prime of life and health;
And now, my course near finisht, what return
Do I receive for all my toil ⁴? Their hate!
Meanwhile my brother, without any care,
Reaps all a father's comforts! Him they love,
Me they avoid3 to him they open all

Their secret eounsels3 dote on him, and both
Repair to him3 while Ι am quite forsaken. ¹
His life they pray for, but expeot my death.
Thus those, brought up by my exeeeding labour,
He, at a small expense, has made his own:

The care all mine, and all the pleasure his.
