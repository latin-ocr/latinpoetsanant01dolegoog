ΟΝ LIFE AND DEATH.

But that they 010 1101 01118, 1111181 always please.
Sweet for the cragsman‚ from some high retreat
Watching the plains below where legions meet,

Το await the moment when the walls of war
Thunder and clash together. But more sweet‚
Sweeter by 101· 011 Wisdom's rampired height

To pace serene the porches 01 1110 113111,

And thence look down —down 011 the purblind herd
Seeking and never finding in the night

The road 10 peace — the peace that all might hold,
But yet is 111188οᾶ by young men and by old,

Lost in the strife for palaces and powerS,

The axes and 1110 lictors and 1110 301(1.

O sightless eyes 1 O hands 11101 1011 111 vain ἔ

Not such your needs! Your nature's needs are twain,
And only twain: and 111080 010 10 110 1100-

Your minds from terror and your bones from pain.
Unailing 11111118, 0 001111 unanxious 1110081-

Grant Nature these and she will do the rest.
Nature will bring yon, be you rich or poor,
Perhaps 1101 much—at all events her 11081.

What though no statued youths from wall and wall
Strew light along your midnight festival,

With golden hands, nor beams from Labanon

Keep the lyre's languor lingering through the hall,
Yours is the table 'neath the high-whispering trees; ’
Ῡο1118 18 1110 lyre 01 1001 and stream and breeze,
The golden flagon and the echoing dome—

Lapt in the Spring, what care you then 101 111080 ?
810011 18 110 sweeter on the ivory bed .
Than yours on moss; and fever’s shafts are sped
As clean through silks damaskt for dreaming kingS‚
As through the hood that wraps the poor man’s head.
What then if all the prince’s glittering store

Yields to his body not one sense the more,

Nor any 00110 01 sever 01 1110111 011

Ι8 barred out by bronze gates or janitor—

What shall the palace‚ what the proud domain

Do for the inind— vain splendours of the vain ⁹?
How shall these minister to a mind diseased,

Or raze one written trouble from the brain ?

Unless you think that conscience with its stings
And misery‚ fears the outward pomp 01 things—-
