40 TITUS LUCRETIUS CARUS.

Fears to push swords and sentinels aside,

And sit the assessor 01 1116 king of kings.

The mind. Ay — there 's the rub! The root is there
Of that one malady which all men share.

It gleams between the haggard lids 01 joy;

It burns a canker in the heart of care.

Within the gold bowl, when the 16681 18 861,

Ι1 lurkS. ’T is bitter in the labourer's sweat.

Feed thou the starving‚ and thou bring'st it back—
Back to the starving, who alone forget.

O you who under silken 0111161118 116,

And you whose only roos-trec is the sky,

What is 1116 011186 11161 blights your lives alike ⁹?

Not that you 11616 10 live, but fear 10 die.

Fear is the poison. Wheresoe'er you 80,

0111 01 1116 skies above, the clods below,

The sense thrills through you 01 801116 pitiless Power
Who scowls at once your father and your foe3

Who 1618 1118 children wander 61 111611 whim,
Choosing their road, as though not bound by him:
But all 111611· 1116 18 rounded with 6 8116116,

Α1111 every road goes down behind the rim 3

And there behind the rim, the swift, the lame,

At different paceS, but their end the same,

Into the dark shall one by one go down,

VVhere the great furnace shakes its hair 01 1161116.

Ο ye who cringe and cower before the throne

01 111111 whose 116611 18 fire, whose hands are stone,
Who shall deliver you from this death in life —
Strike off your chains, and make your 801118 your own ⁸?

ΙΙ.

Come 111110 1116 611 ye that labour ! Ye

Whose souls 616 heavy-laden‚ come 10 1116,

Α1111 Ι will lead you forth by streams that 11661, -
And feed you with 1116 1111111 that sets men free 1
Not from myself, poor 801118 with 1661 1016110116, ¹
Not from myself Ι have it, but from one

,At whose approach the lamps of all the wise

Fade and go out like stars before the sun.

I am the messenger 01 0116 that saith

His saving sentence through my humbler breath:
