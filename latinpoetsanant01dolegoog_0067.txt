ΟΝ LIFE AND DEATH. 41

And would you know this gospel’s name, ’13 13 131113 -
Τ116 healing Gospel of Eternal Death.

A teacher 116, 13116 1613011613 of whose shoe

Ι 6111 11013 worthy stooping to undo:

And on your aching brows and weary eyes

His saving sentence shall descend like dew.

For this 13 116 that dared the almighty foe,

Lookt up, and struck the Olympian blow for blow,
And dragged the phantom from his fancied skies—
The Samian Sage ¹—the first of those that know.
Him not the splintered lightnings, nor the roll

Of thunders daunted. Undismayed his soul

Rose‚ and outsoared the thunder‚ plumbed the abySS‚
And scanned the wheeling worlds from pole to pole3
And from the abyss brought back for you and me
The secret that alone can set men free.

He showed us how the world and worlds began,

And what things can, and what things cannot be.
And as Ι hear his clai-ion, I — Ι 1300

See earth and heaven laid open 130 my view ᾗ

And 10, from earth and heaven the curse is gone,
And all the things that are, 616 110111 anew.

Vision divine! Far off in crystal air,

What forms 616 1311636 ⁶? The immortal Gods are there.
Ay— but what Gods ? Not those that trembling men
Would bribe with offeringS‚ and appease with prayer.
Far off they 116, where storm-winds never blow,

Nor ever storm-cloucl moves across the glow3

Nor frost of Winter nips them, nor their limbs

Feel 13116 white fluttering of one plume of snow.

At ease they dream, and make perpetual cheer

Far off. From them we nothing have to sear,
Nothing to hope. How should the calm ones hate. *7
The tearless know the meaning of a tear?

We leave, we bless them, 111 their homes on high.

No atheist is my master, he, nor I:

But when Ι 1311111 and seek the stain of Hel]

Which flames and smokes along the nadir sky,

Even as I gaze, the ancient shapes of 111

Flicker and fade. From off the accursed hill

The huge stone melts. The Ixionian wheel
