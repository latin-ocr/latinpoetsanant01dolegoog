ΟΝ LII-'E AND DEATH.

Shalt go, Thou art going, 110111· by honi-,like 1116361
Nothing abides. Thy 3663 111 (16116616 haze

Go off3 those mooned sands forsake their plaoe;
And where they are, shall other 3663 111 turn

Mow with their scythes of whiteness other bayS.
Lo, how the terraoed towers, and monstrous round
Of league-long ramparts rise from out the ground,
With gardens in the clouds l Then all is gone,
And Babylon is a memory and a mound.

Observe this dew-drenoht rose of Tyrian grain—

A rose to-day. But you will ask in vain
To-morrow what it is; and yesterday

It was the dust, the sunshine and the rain.

This bowl of milk, the pitoh on yonder jar,

Are strange and far-bound travellers come from far.
This is a snowflake that was once a flame —

The flame was once the fragment of a star.

Round‚ angular‚ soft, 11111116, dry, eold, warm,
Things are their qualities: things are their form —
And these in oombination, even as bees,

Not singly but combined, make up the swarm:
And when the qualities like bees on wing‚

Having a moment clustered, 66636 10 611113,

Α3 1116 thing dies without its qualitieS,

So die the qualities without the thing!

Where is the ooolness when 110 6661 11111(13 blow ’ἶ
Where is the 11111316 when the lute lies low ’ἰ

Α16 1101 1116 redness and the red rose one,

And the snow's whiteness one thing with 1116 311011 ?
Even so, now mark me, here we reaoh the goal

Of Scienoe‚ and in 111116 11616 the whole —

Even as the redness and the rose are 0116,

80 with the body 0116 thing 13 1116 301111

For, as our limbs and organs all unite

To make our sum of suffering and delight‚

And, without eyes and ears and touch ancl tongue‚
Were no such things as 16316 and sound and sight.
80 without these we all iu vain shall try

To find the thing that gives them unity—

43

Τ116 thing to 11111611 66611 whisperS, “ Thou art thou '' -—

The soul which answers each, “ And I am I.”
What 1 shall the dateless worlds in dust be blown
Back to the unremembered and unknown,
