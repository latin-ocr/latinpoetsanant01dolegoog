44 TITUS LUCRETIUS CARUS.

And this frail Thou—this flame of yesterday—
Burn on, forlorn, immortal, and alone ?

Did Nature in the nurseries of the night

Tend it for this —Nature whose heedless might,
Like some poor shipwreckt sailor, takes the babe,
And casts it bleating on the shores of light ⁰?
What is it there ἱ) Α cry is all it is l

It knows not if its limbs 116 yours or 1118.

Less than that cry the babe was yesterday.

The man 130-16011011· shall be less than this.
Tissue by tissue to a 80111 116 grow8,

As leaf by leaf the rose becomes the rose.

Tissue from tissue 1018; and, as the Sun

Goes from the bubbles, when they burst, 116 goes!
Ah, mark those pearls of Snnrise! Fast and free
Upon the waves they are dancing. Souls shall be
Things that outlast their bodies„ when each spark
Outlasts its wave, each wave 0111316818 13116 sea!
The seeds that once were we take flight and fly,
Winnowed to earth, or whirled along the sky,

Not 1081 11111 disunited. Life lives on.

It is the liveS‚ the lives, 1116 lives that die!

They go beyond recapture and recall,

Lost in 1116 all-indissoluble All : —

Gone like the rainbow from the fountain’s foam,
Gone like the spindrift shuddering down the squall.
Flakes of the water, on the waters cease.

80111 of the body, 111611 and sleep like 111686,
Atoms 130 atoms —weariness 10 1681-

Α81168 10 681168 —hopes and fears to peace!

O Science‚ lift aloud thy voice 11161 811118

Τ116 pulse of fear and through the conscience thrills —
Thrills through the conscience with the news of peace—-
How beautiful thy feet 616 on the hillsl

IV.

Death is for 118, then, nothing—a mere name
For the mere noiseless ending of a flame.

It 1111118 118 11013, for there is nothing left

To hurt: and as of old, when Carthage came
To battle, we an'd 01118 felt naught at all,
Nor quailed to see city and farm and stall
