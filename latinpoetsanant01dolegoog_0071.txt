· ΟΝ LIFE AND DEATH.

Flare into dust, and all our homeless fields
Trampled beneath the hordes of Hannibal,

But slumbered on and on, nor cared a jot,

Deaf to the stress and tumult, though the lot

of things was doubtful, to which lords should fall
The rule of all—but we, we heeded not—-

So when that wedlock of the flesh aud mind,
Which makes us what we are, shall cease to bind,
And mind and flesh‚ being mind and flesh no more,
Powdered to dust go whistling down the wind,
Even as our past was shall our future be 2

Others may start and tremble‚ but not we,
Though heaven with the disbanded dust of earth
Be dark, or earth be drowned beneath the sea:
Why then torment ourselves, and shrink aghast
Like timorous children from the great At Last ⁸?
For though the Future holds its face averse,

See that hid face reflected in the past,

As in a shield. Look 1 Does some monster seem
To threaten there ’.Ρ Ι8 11101 the Gorgou's gleam ⁴?
What meets your eyes is nothing—or a face
Even gentler than a sleep without a dream.

And yet ——ah, thou who art about to cease

From 1011 and lapse into perpetual peace,

Why willlthe mourners stand about thy bed,

And sting thy parting hour with words like these ⁶?

“ ‘Never 811011 111011 behold thy dear home more,
Never thy wife await thee at thy door,

Never again thy little climbing boy

A father's kindness in thine eyes explore.

All you have toiled for, all you have loved,'' they say,

“ Is gone, is taken in a single day ; ’²
But never add, “ All memory, all desire,
All love— these likewise shall have passed away.''

Ah ignorant mourners! Did they only see

The fate which Death indeed lays up for 11100,

How would they sing a different song from this —-

“ Beloved, not thou the sufferer —not thou3 but we.
Thou hast lost us a113 but thou, redeemed from pain,
- Shalt sleep the sleep that kings desire in vain.

Thou hast left us a113 and 10, for us, for 118,
