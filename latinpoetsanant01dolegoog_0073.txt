You would find nothing sweet and nothing new.
Pleasure and power, the friend'8‚ the lover's kiss,
Would bring you weariness in place of bliss.

You would turn aside and say, ‘ I have known them all,
And am long tired of this, aud this, and this!

But he is Sisyphus wh0, athirst for power,
Fawns on the crowd, and 130118 and fails to gain
The orowd’s vile suffrage. What a doom is 1118-
Abased and unrewarded. 18 11013 131118
