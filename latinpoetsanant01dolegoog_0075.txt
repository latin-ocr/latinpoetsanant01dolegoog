ΟΝ LIFE AND DEATH.

He would hail the road by which he shall at last
Escape the questing monster and be free!

He shall escape it even by that same way

On which Fear whispers him 't will turn to bay:
For on that road the questing monster dies

Like a man's shadow 011 0 sunless day.

Brother ,01111 friend, this life brings joy and ease
And love to some, to some the lack of these —
Only the lack3 to others 10018 and pain3

But at the last it brings to all the peace

That passes understanding. Sweet, thrice sweet
This healing gospel of the nnplumbed retreat,
Where, though not drinking, we shall no more thirst,
And meeting not, shall no more wish to meet.

“Thy wife, thy home, 1110 child that climbed thy knee,
Are sinking down like sails behind 1110 800.”
Β1001110 10 1110 dying this 3 but breathe as well

“ All love for these shall likewise pass from thee.'’
Brother, if I should watch 111011 1081 113111 8111110

111 111080 loved eyeS, those dying ears of 1111110
Should 11001 1110 murmur what, when my hour 0011108,
Ι would some friend might murmur 11110 1111110. -
11081, 1081, perturbed bosom —heart forlorn,

With thoughts of ended joys and evil borne,
And—worse—-of evil done3 for they, like thee,
811011 1081 -- those others thou 11081 1110ἀο 10 111011111.
Even if there lurk behind some veil of sky

The fabled Maker, the 1111111011οῙ Spy,

Ready to tot-ture each poor life he made,

Thou canst do more than God can —- thou canst die.
Will not the thunders of thy God be dumb

When thou art deaf forever ⁶? Can the Sum

Of all things bruise 111101 18 1101 ⁴? Nay—take heart3
For where thou goest thither no God 0011 cornel
11081, brother, rest! Have you done ill or well,
Rest‚ rest 1 There is no God, no Gods who dwell
Crowned with avenging righteousness 011 111311,

Nor frowning ministers of their hate in Hell.

None shall accuse thee, none shall judge3 for lo,
Those others have forgotten long ago:
