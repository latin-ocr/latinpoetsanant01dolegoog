52 TITUS LUCRETIUS CARUS.

Laying quite bare what ean and cannot be,
How to each force is set strong boundarieS‚
How no power raves unehained 3 and now Religion lies
Trampled by us; and unto us 't is given
Fearless with level gaze to sean the heaven.

Yet fear I lest thou haply deem that thus
We sin and enter wicked ways of reas ’11.
Whereas 'gainst all things good and beauteous
’T is oft Religion does the foulest treason.
Has not the tale of Aulis come to us
And those great ehiefs who, in the windless season,
Bade young Iphianassa’s form be laid
Upon the altar of the Trivian maid ⁶?

Soon as the fillet round her virgin hair

Fell in its equal lengths down either 0113311,-
Soon as she saw her father standing there,

Sad, by the altar, without power to speak‚
And at his side the murderous minister,

Hiding the knife, and many a faithful Greek
Weeping— her knees grew weak, andwith no sound
She sank‚ in speeehless terror, on the ground.

But naught availed it in that hour aeeurst
To save the maid from such a doom as this,
That her lips were the babylips that first
Called the King father with their 01· 133 and kiss.
For round her came the strong men, and none durst
Refuse to do what eruel part was his;
So silently they raised her up, and b01e 1131·
All quivering, to the deadly shrine before her.

And as they bore her, ne’er a golden lyre

Rang round her coming with a bridal strain;
Β1113 111 13113 very season of desire,

A stainless maiden‚ amid bloody stain
She died—a vietim felled by its own sire—-

That so the ships the wisht-for winds might gain
And air puff out their oanvas. Learn thou, then,
To what damned deeds Religion urges men.
