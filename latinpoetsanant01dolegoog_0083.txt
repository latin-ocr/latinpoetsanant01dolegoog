CAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.

exeramus, the most elegant of the lyric poets of Rome,
was born at or near Verona, about 87 B.c. He inherited
considerable property, which, when he went to Rome, and
was received into the fashionable fast set, he proceeded to
squander. In the year 62 Metellus Celer as praetor had
his residence in Verona, and was accompanied by his wife
Clodia, a woman of thirty-two, brilliant and profligate,
‘herself a poet and acquainted with Greek letters. Catul-
lus either there οι· in Rome became intimate with her
and addressed to her a series of passionate love-poemS,
through which may be traced the rise‚ progress. and
decay of his adoration. This affair lasted some four
yearS, until at least 57, when the final rupture with his
“Lesbia '' occurred, and he went with Memmius to Bithy-
nia, where he hoped to repair his shattered fortunes. In
this he was disappointed, if one may jndge by a poem
which he wrote concerning his experiences. During his
absence his beloved brother Hortalus died, and he recorded
his grief in a beautiful elegy. During the last three years
of his short life he lived mostly at his country homes
either at Sirmio, a promontory extending into what is now
known as the Lago di Garda, or at Tibur, not far from
Rome. Nothing is known of the exact date of his death3
some authorities give 54, others 47. His poems were lost
until the fourteenth century, when two manuscripts were
discovered in Verona. They consist of one hundredand
sixteen pieces, many of them brief, others extending to a
length of four hundred lines. Besides the love-poems
addressed to “ Lesbia,'' there are bits of fierce satire and
charming descriptionS‚ mythological and fanciful, in vary-
ing metres. A complete edition of the original, with
verse translations by Sir Richard Burton and prose ren-
derings by Leonard C. Smithers, was privately published
in 1894. The “ Lesbia '' poemS, translated and arranged
in plausible sequence by J. H. A. Tremenheere‚ were
issued in 1897. Sir Theodore Martin also translated all
