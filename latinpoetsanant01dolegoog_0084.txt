58 CAIUS VALERIUS CA TULLUS.

of Catullus. Single poems have been versified or imitated
by many modern poets.

Tennyson commemorates his address to his brother and
his residenoe at Sirmio in one of his most beautiful and
melodious poems z —-

“ Row us out from Desenzano, to your Sirmione rowl
So they rowed, and there we landed— ⁴ Ο venusta Sirmio l ’
There to me thro’ all the groves os olive in the summer glow,
There beneath the Roman ruin where the purple flowers grow,
Came that ‘ Ave atque Vale ’ of the Poet's hopeless woe,
Tenderest os Roman poets nineteen hundred years ag0,
⁴ Frater Ave atque Vale ’ — as we wandered to and fr0,
Gazing at the Lydian laughter of the Garda Lake below,
Sweet Catullus’ all-but-islaud‚ olive-silvery Sirmio l ’⁹

ΑΒΒΒΕ88 ΤΟ LESBIA·

ΗῙΜ rival to the gods I place,
Him loftier yet, if loftier be,

Who, Lesbia, sits before th face,
Who listens and who loo{s on thee3

Thee smiling soft. Yet this delight
Doth all my sense eonsign to death3
For when thou dawnest on my sight,
Ah wretched! flits my labouring breath 3 ¹

My tongue is palsied. Subtly hid
Fire oreeps me through from limb to limb:

My loud ears tingle all unbid:
Twin clouds of night mine eyes bedjml

Ease is thy plague3 ease makes thee void,
Catullus, with these vacant hours,

And wauton: ease, that hath destroyed
Great kings and states with all their powers!
