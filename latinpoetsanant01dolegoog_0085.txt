THE HISTORY OF A PASSION. 59

ΙΙ.

Δ COMPARISON. ⁹

Most beautiful in many eyes
Is Quinctia, and in mine

Her shape is tall, and straight withal‚
And her complexion fine.

These single oharms of form and face
I grant that she ean show3

But all the concentrated grace
Of “ beautiful‚'' oh, no!

For nowhere in her ean you find
That subtle, voioeless art——

That something which delights the mind,
And satisfies the heart.

But Lesbia 's beautiful, I swear3
And for herself she stole

The char-ms most rare of every fair,
To frame a perfect whole.

- Translation of Sm Tnnononn Mur-rm.

LESBIA OBDURATE.

For what woe

I bare of the wily Cyprian queen you know,
And how she wrought me, kindling my desire
Hot as Thermopylae or AEtna's fire.

My eyeS‚ grown sad with weeping oft-renewed,
Forever melted, all my oheeks bedewed

With melancholy rain.

— Translation of J. H. A. Tunnnunnnn.
