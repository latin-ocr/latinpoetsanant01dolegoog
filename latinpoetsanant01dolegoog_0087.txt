THE HISTORY OF A PASSION. 61

Lest over-irk I give which still of fools is the fashion.

Often did Juno eke Queen of the Heavenly host

Boil wi' the rabidest rage at dire default of a husband

Learning the manifold thefts of 1191· omnivolent Jove. . . .

Yet was she never 10 1119 by hand paternal committed

Whenas she came to my house reeking Assyrian scents 3

N ay in the darkness of night her furtive favour-s 3119
(191 ned me,

Self- willged taking herself from very mate’ s very breast.

Wherefore I hold it enough since given to us and us
onl

Boon ofy that day with 810119 whiter than wont she

'ro LESBIA's srAnnow.

Sparrow! my nymph’s delicious pleasure.
Who with thee, her pretty measure,
Fanciful in frolic plays
Thousand, thousand wauton ways3
And fluttering, lays 10 panting rest
On the soft orbings of her breast3
Thy beak with finger-tip incites
And dallies with thy becks and bites;
When my beauty, my desire,
Feels her darling whim inspire‚
. With nameless triflings such as these
To snatch‚ I trow, a tiny ease
For some 'keen fever of the breast‚
Ι While passion toys itself to rest3
Ι would that happy lady be,
And so in pastime sport with thee
And lighten love’ 3 soft agony.
The sweet resource were bliss untold,
Dear as that apple of ripe gold
Which, by the nimble virgin found,
Unloost the zone that had so fast been bound!
