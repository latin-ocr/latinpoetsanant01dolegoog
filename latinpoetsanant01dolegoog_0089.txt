THE HISTORY OF A PASSION.

May a lion cross me 111010,
With his green-eyed angry glare.''

Love stood listening in (10113111,
And sneezed his auspice on the right.

Acme, as her lover said,

Lightly bending back her head,

And with lips of ruby skimming

His' tipsy eyes in pleasure swimming3
“ Septimillus! dai-ling mine!

So may we thus ever cutwine,
Victims vowed at Cupid's shrine,

As, with still more keen requita18‚
Thou art felt within my vitals 1”

Love stood listening in delight‚
And sneezed his auspice on the right.

In the heavenly omen blest‚

They love, caressing and carest3
The poor youth would lightlier prize
Syria's groves than Acme's eyes3
Acme centres in the boy

All her longings, all her joy3

who more bless'd has moi-tals seen ?
When has a kinder passion been ?

VIII.

LIVE AND LOVE.

We 'll live and love, my Lesbia, thou and Ι,
Not cai-ing one brass·farthing (currency)‚

If aged scandal-mongers spread a tale,

Or is: the strait-laced Puritans say “ Fie 1 '²
“The sun dies‚'' yes! to rise in death's despite3
But thou and Ι, when once the little light

Of our two lives is set, must sleep alway

The eternal sleep of one eternal night.
