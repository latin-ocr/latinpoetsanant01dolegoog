64 CAJUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.

IX.

UNNU'MBERED KISSES.

How many kisses showered on thee -
Were plenty and to spate for 'me ¹?

Oh, count the Libyan sands that girt
Cyrene, land of laserwort,

From horrid Ammon's voice of doom
Ἴ To hoary Battus' holy tomb.

Oount stars at hush of night that spy
When lovers meet clandestinely.

So many kisses plenty were

For fond Catullus and to spare,
Beyond the count of prying eyes
Or evil ‘tongues' malignities!

— Translacion of J. H. A. Tnnummnmun.

Χ.

ΤΟ BEAUTIFUL EYESL

Oh, if I thine eyes might kiss,
And my kisses were not orimeS‚
I would snateh that honeyed bliss
Full three hundred thousand times! ·

N or should these a surfeit bring,

Not though that sweet orop should yield
Kisses far outnumbering

Corn-ears in the harvest-field.

— Translacion of Sui Tnnononn Murrus.

XI.

A Pon‘r's ευΡΡΕῙιτ

Soon shalt thou feast, Fabullus mine,
At my house — should the gods incline —
If. thou wilt only feteh with thee
