THE HISTORY OF A PASSION.' 65
Α good big generous dinner— 833 ⁸? l
And bring a lively girl and wine

And 83113 of wit and gayety.

If all 1311383 things 1311011 ’113 bring or send
Thou 8113113 feast well, my charming friend!
For thy Catullus' fortune ebbs:

His fao is full of spiders' webS.

For my dear girl! When she bestows
This sweetness on thee and it glows
On thy olfactories, thou wilt pray
The GodS‚ Fabullus: “ From 131118 day
Oh, make me nothing but a nose ! ’'

Our Lesbia is compared with you ’.Ρ

Ah, foolish world and tasteless too,

Why rave, CatulluS, passion-bost?
What 's dead and gone, why, count as lost.
