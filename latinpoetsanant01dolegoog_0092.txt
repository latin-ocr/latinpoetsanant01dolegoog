OAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.

. You fluttering where your lady led

Beloved as shall again be none!
Then many a merry thing was done
That you desired nor she forbade3
Now she forbids, desire were folly3
Seek not what flies! Hang melancholyl
Be colel and hard and oold and harder still.
Catullus hardens: sweet, farewell! “
He 'll woo you not against your bent.
But, naughty one, you 'll soon repent
When no one eomes at night to woo.
What sort of life is left for γοα ⁴?
Uncourted, unadmired, without
Some one to love, to be teased about,
To kiss, to bite i' the lip ?

But you,
Catullus, harden through and through.

— Translation of J. H. A. Tnnnnuunn.

XIV.

imru'rmo' A snAnnnR.

Do you think I could slander my Life,
Who is dearer than both of my eyes ⁶?
Oh, no! If Ι could, I should never
Consume with such passionate sever.
But whenever a horror is rife,

’T is you and the Sot give it rise.

— Translation os J. H. A. Tannnnmmmt.

XV.

LOVE DETECTED.

Lesbia does nothing else but flout me,

She cannot hold her tongue about me!
Then hang me, but she loves me dearly 1
What proof ⁶? My own behaviour clearly:
For Ι attaok her just as stoutly,

Yet hang me! her I love devoutly.

—.Translation os J. H. A. Tutununnnn.
