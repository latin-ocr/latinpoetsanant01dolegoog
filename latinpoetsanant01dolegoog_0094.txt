Α PERPETUAL VOW.

My Life, you swear this love of ours
Shall pleasant and perpetual be!
Fulfil her promise, Heavenly Power8‚
And grant it honest, frank, and free!
That all our lives be ordered by
This league of solemn amity.

on WOMAn's INCONSTANCY.

My mistress sayS‚ there 's not a man
Of all the many that she know8‚

She 'd rather wed than me, not one,
Though Jove himself were to propose.

She says so 3 — but what woman says
Το him who fancies he has caught her,
’T is only fit it should be writ

In air or in the running water.

LOVE IN RUINS.

Lesbia! you used to say you were
Catullus' own3

To me not Jove would you prefer,
And thereupon

I loved you as no mistress mere,
But as a son

Or daughter's husband is held dear —
Now you are known 1

And though my passion 's livelier
And fieroer grown,
