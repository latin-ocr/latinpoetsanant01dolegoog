THE HISTORY OF A PASSION.

More vile' and worthless you appear—
The wrong you 've done

May 'make Desii-e to wanton freer‚
But lays Love prone!

69

— Translation os J. H. A. Tnssmennnnnn.

XXI.

LOVE ILL-REQUITED.

Such love as woman never won .
Was, Lesbia! mine for thee;

Such truth as never league had known
Thy love had found in me!

My heart, by falseness now repelled,
Yet vain with passion strive33

Turn honest, yet esteem were killed,
Be vile, yet love sui-vives!

- Translatz'on os J. Η. A. TREMENHEERE.

XXII.

THE LAST AGONY.

I love and hate. Ah, never ask why so!
I hate and love—and that is all I know.
Ι see 't is folly, but I feel ’t is woe!

—Paraphrase os WALTER SAVAGE LANnon.

XXIII:

RENUNCIATION.

To treasure thoughts of kindness shown
And feel no duty left undone, —-

No outraged faith, no league of love
Betrayed in moek appeal to J ove --

If this be pleasure, many a joy,
Catullus, waits yon by and by

From this ungrateful love! By you

All kindly things to say or do
