70 CAJUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.

Were said and done 3 -au to no good
Offered to such ingratitudo.

Why further rack yourself ἶ) Ο borrow
Strength for withdrawal yet more thorough,
And grieve not Heaven by wooing Sorrow! ,
’Τ 18 hard at once old love to quell.

’Τ 18 hard, but you must do it still.
This is your only chance of life3

Victor you must be in this strife.

11 111011361 0611, 11118 you shall do—

Ay, even though he cannot too!

O God! 11 Τ111116 be pity— if Thou

E' en in the jaws of death ere now

Hast wrought salvation— look on me,
And if my life seem fair to Tbee‚

O tear this 11163116, 11118 011186 away
Which, 361111113 011 1116 day by day,

A 0166111113, slow paralysis,

Hath driven away all happiness,

I ask Thee not that she return

My love, nor that she yet may yearn
For Purity —oh, that were vain!

I pray but to be well again,

Quit of this foul disease. Ο 111688
Τ11118, 111118, O God! my duteousness!

HIS LAS'P F4REWELL ΤΟ LESBIA.

Comi-ades! whom I can trust to stand by me
Whether I pierce 10 India's further shore,
Where beats the 81111 611(1 thunders evermore3
Whether where Nile discolours all the 866
Seven-mouthed 3 or yonder airy Alps transcend
To meditate on things memorial,

01 Caesar's greatness in the Rhine-swept Gaul,
And savage Britain where the world hath end3
Ready with me to dare what Heaven shall will!
This bitter cry bear her I loved 01 yore 3 —
“Ah, shameless‚ shameless lust! Sweet‚ seek no more
