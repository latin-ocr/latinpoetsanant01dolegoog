'72 CAJUS VALERIUS CA TULLUS.

They were a purchase Cinna made

(Caius Cinna, my good friend)—

It was the same thing in the end,

Whether a purchase or a loan—

I always used them as my own3

Only the phrase was inexaot— .

Η6 bought them for himself in fact.

But you have caught the general vioe

Of being too correct and nice,

Overourious and precise3

And seizing with precipitation

The slight negleots of conve1·sation.’'
— Translation os J. Hooxfflm Fnssmz.

 

ADIEU ΤΟ BITHYNIA.

Now Spring his oooly mildness brings us back,
Now the equinootial heaven's rage and wraok
Hushes at hest of Zephyr's bonny breeze.

Far left (Catullus 1) to the Phrygian leas ’
And summer-y Nieaea's fertile downs:

Fly we to Asia's fame-illumined towns

Now lust my fluttering thoughts for wayfare long,
Now my glad eager feet grow steady, strong.
O fare ye well, my comrades‚ pleasant throng‚
Ye who together far from homesteads flying‚
By many various ways come homeward hieing.

- Translation os Sm Rmffllssn Boni-ox.

 

A WELCOME HOME.

DEAREs'r of all, Verannius 1 O my friend!
Hast thou 601116 back from thy long pilgrimage‚
With brothers twain in soul thy days to spend‚
And by thy hearth-fire 611661· thy mother's age ?

And art thou truly come ? 011, weleome news!
And I shall see thee safe, and hear once more

Thy tales of Spain, its tribes, its feats, its yieWS‚ ·
Flow as of old from thy exhaustless store.
