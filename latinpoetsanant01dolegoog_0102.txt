Bring her hither, bound 10 move,
Drawn and led with bands of lovel
Like the tendet twine
Which the searching ivy plieS,
Clinging in a thousand ties
O'er the clasping pine l

Gentle virgins, you besideS,

Whom the like event, betideS,
With the coming year3

Best befits his ear!

“Is there any deity

Worthy 1,0 be worshipt more3
Master of a richer store
Of wealth and happiness ’ἲ

“ Youth and age alike agree,
Serving and adoring thee,
The source of hope 31ιά care.
Care and hope alike engage
The waryp parent: sunk in age
And the restless heir.

“ She, the maiden‚ half· afraid,

Hears the new proposal made,
That proceeds from thee3

You resign and hand her over

To the rash and hardy lover
With 3 fixt. decree.

“ Hymen, Hymen, you preside,

Maintaining honour and the pride
Of women free from blame,

With 3 solemn warrant given,

Is there any power in heaven
