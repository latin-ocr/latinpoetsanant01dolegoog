CAIUS VALERIUS CA TULLUS.

Aurunculeia‚ eease your tearS,

And when to-m0r1·0w's morn appearS,
Fear not that the sun

Will dawn upon a fairer face,—

Nor in his airy, lofty raee
Behold a lovelier one 1

Mark and hear uS‚ gentle bride3
Behold the torehes nimbly plied,
Waving here and there3
Along the street and in the poreh,
See the fiery-tressed torch
Spreads its sparkling hair!

Like a lily, fair and chaste‚

‚ Lovely bride, you shall be placed

In a gai-den gay,
A wealthy lord's delight and· pride3
Come away then, happy bride,
Hasten‚ hence away! ‘

Mark and hear us— he your lord‚
Will be true ab bed and board‚

Nor ever walk astray,
Withdrawing from your lovely side;
Mark and hear ue, gentle bride,

Hasten, hence away!

Like unto a tender vine,

He shall ever clasp and twine‚
Clinging night and day,

Fairly bound and firmly bied3

Come away, then, happy bride,
Hasten‚ come away 1

Make ready 1 There I see within

The bride is veiled3 the gues'cs begin θ

To muster close and slow:
Trooping onward close about,
