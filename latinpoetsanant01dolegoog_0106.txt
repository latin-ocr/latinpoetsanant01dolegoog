82 ² C'AIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.

THE WEDDING SUPPER.

See the couch with crimson dress —
Where, seated in the deep receSS,

With expectation warm,
The bridegroom views her coming near,—
The slender youth that led her here

May now release her arm Ξ

With a fixt intense regard

He beholds her close and hard
In awful interview:

Shortly now she must be sped

To the chamber and the bed,
With attendance due.

Let the ancient worthy wives

That have passed their constant lives
With a single mate,

As befits advised age,

With council and precaution sago
Assist and regulate.

She, the mistress of the band,
Comes again with high command,
“ Bridegroom, go your way3
There your bride is in the bower,
Like a lovely lily flower,
Or a rose in May 1

“ Ay, and you yourself in truth
Are a goodly proper youth,
Proper, tall and fair3
Venus and the Graces too
' Have befriended each of you
For a lovely pair i '⁹

Fear not! with the coming year,

The new Torquatus will be here,
Him we soon shall see

With infant gesture fondly seek

To reach his father-'s manly cheek,
From the mother's knee!
