For ’t was told of yore how forced by pestilenoe 011161,
Eke as a bloody rite due for the Androgeonian murder,
Many a 01106611 youth and the bloom of damsels unmarried
Food for the Minotaur, Cecropia was wont to besurnish.
Seeing his narrow walls in such wise vexed with evile,
Theseus of freest will for dear-loved Athens his body
Offered a victim 60 11161 110 111016 10 Crete be deported
Lives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;
