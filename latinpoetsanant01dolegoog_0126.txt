ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIEND.

hv, Calvus, feeling lingere in the tomb,
And shades are touched by sense of morta] beare,
Mourning in fresh regrets love's vanished bloom‚
Weeping the dear delights of vanished years;

Then might 1161· early fate with lighter grief
Thy lost Quinctilia' 8 gentle spirit fill,

To cherish, where she bides, the assured belief
That 8116 18 nearest, (16616811 to t-hee still.

PLEASAN Τ RECOLLECTION S.

How pleasantly‚ Licinius, went

The hours which yesterday we spent,
Engaged as men like 118 befits

In keen encounter of our wits!

My tablets still the records bear

Of all the good things jotted. there:

The wit, the repartee that flew

From you to me, from me to you:

The gay bright verse that seemed. to 8111116
More sparkling than the sparkling wine.

ΟΝ Α ROMAN 'ARRY.

Wmmnvm 'Arry tried to sound
An H, his care was unavailing3

He alwa 8 spoke of 'orse and 'ound,
And 6 1118 kinsfolk had that failing.

Peaee to our ears. He went from home3

But tidings came that grieved 118 bitterly —
That 'Ar ,while he stay ed. at Rome,

Enjoye 1118 'oliday 111 yHitaly.
