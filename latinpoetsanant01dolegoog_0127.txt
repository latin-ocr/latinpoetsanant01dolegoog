A DEDI CA TION. 103

ΤΟ CICERO.

Moszr eloquent of all the Roman raee
That is, hath been, or shall be afterward‚
To thee Catullus tenders highest grace,
Sorriest of poets in his own regard3
Yea‚ sorriest of poets, ay, and worst,
As Tully is of all our pleaders first.

— Translation os Jauns DAvms.

 

ΤΟ Α LITTLE ORATOR.

Wmm in that wondrous speech of his,
My Calvus had denounced
Vatinius, and his infamies
Most mereilessly trounoed —

A voice the buzz of plaudits elove —
ι My sides 1 nearly split
With laughter, as it eried, “ By Jove!
An eloquent tom-tit 1 '²

— Translation os Sm Tmononn Mun-m.

 

A DEDICATION.

Mr little volume is complete,

F'msh pumice-polished‚ aud as neat
As book need wish to be3

And now, what patron shall 1 choose

For these gay sallies of my Muse ?
Cornelius, whom but thee ⁴?

For though they are but trifles, thou
Some value didst to them allow,

And that from thee is fame, .
Who daredst in thy three volumes' space,
Alone of all ItalianS, trace

Oux- history and name.
