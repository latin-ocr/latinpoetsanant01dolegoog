LABERIUS.

LABERIUS was born about 107 13.c. He was of the
equestrian order, but distinguished himself as a writer
of mimes. In October, 45, Publius Syrus, a professional
actor, challenged all his craft to a trial of wit in extempo-
raneous' farce. Caesar, who was then celebrating his tri-
umphal gameS‚ offered Laberius five hundred thousand
sesterces to appear on the stage. This was equivalent to
a command3 and the aged knight reluctantly obeyed, for
. the profession of a mimus was regarded as infamouS. But
he used the degradation to effect his revenge3 his pro-
logue‚ which has been preserved, aroused compassion‚ and
his lines were full of pointed wit which the Roman audi-
ence were quick enough to appreciate. In the person of
a Syrian slave being whipped, he exclaimed, “Faitl1,
Quirites, but we have lost our freedom,'' and again he
exclaimed‚ “Many he needs must fear who is by many
feared.'' All eyes were turned on the dictator. The
people realized that in LaberiuS‚ Caesar was purposely
degrading the Roman nobility. Caesar awarded the prize
to Syrus. Laberius died two years later at Puteoli. He
was very popular with his contemporaries, ranking in
vigour above Terence and next to Plautus.

PROLOGUE.

NEoEssrrY — the current of w-hose sway

Many would stem, but few can find the way, —

To what abasement has she made nie bend,

Now when life's pulse is ebbing to its end!

Whom no ambitious aim, no sordid hait,

Fear, force, nor influence of the grave and great.
Nor meed of praise, nor any lure beside,

Could move, when youthful‚ from my place of pride
Lo in mine age how easily I fall!

One honied speech from ,Caesar's tongue was all;
