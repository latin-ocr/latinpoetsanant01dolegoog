106 , LABERIUS.

For how might Ι resist his sovereign will,
Whose every wish the Gods themselves fulfil ?
Twiee thirty years without a blemish spent,
Forth from my home this morn a knight I went,
And thither I return —- as what ? a mime!
Oh, Ι have lived one day beyond my time!
Fortune — still wayward both in bad and good,
If 't was thy pleasure in thy changeful mood,
To tear the wreath of honour from my brow,
Why was I not far earlier taught to bow,
When with such aid as youth and strength afford,
I might have won the crowd and pleased their lord ἱ)
Now, why thus humbled in the frost of age ⁴?
What scenio virtues bring I to the stage ¹?
What fire of soul‚ what dignity of mien,
What powers of voice to grace the mimie soene ⁴?

. As creeping ivy kills the strangled tree,
So the long olasp of years has dealt with me.
N aught left, alas. ἲ of all my former fame,
Save the poor legend of a tomb— —my name!
