PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Vnnen. (or Virgil) was born October 15, 70 B.C., in the
small village of Andes (now Pietola), not far from Mantua
in Cisalpine'Gaul, where his father, who was probably a
man of some meanS, had a farm. He was carefully edu-
cated at Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and after he
had assumed the toga, at N aples. He learned Greek, and
at Rome studied the Epicurean philosophy under Syron.
His feeble health may have been the cause of his retire-
ment to his farm, from which he was dispossessed after
the battle of Philippi. The governor, Asinius Pollio, ad-
vised him to apply to Octavianus at Rome for the resti-
tution of his property. The first Eclogue is supposed to
commemorate his gratitude for the favour granted. In
Rome, Vergil became acquaiuted with that munificent

patron of literature, Caius Cilnius Maecenas, who gathered ,

around him that notable coterie which was the glory of
the Augustan age. At the request of Maecenas he wrote
the “ Georgics,’' the most finished of his works. The last
lines he composed at Naples, after the battle of Actium,
31 nc, Four years later Augustus wrote Vergil from
Spain, asking of him some great poetical work. The
poet, who had long contemplated an epic on the subject
of AEneas, the mythical founder of Rome, complied. In
the year'23, Caesar's nephew Marcellus died, and Vergil
introduced into the Sixth Book of the “AEneid'' the mem-
orable passage which caused Octavia, when she heard it,
to swoon. In 20 Vergil was in Athene, and there met
Augustus. He had intended to make a tour of Greece‚
but instead went back to Italy with the emperor. Shortly
after his return he died at Brundusium (Brindisi), Sep·
tember 22, 19 no. He was buried in a tomb on the road
leading from Naples to Pozzuoli. The inscription on the
tomb, translated, reads ε -

“ Mantua brought me forth, Calabria smote me, now holds me
’ Parthenope. 1 have sung shepherds‚ tarmei-s, and wars.”
