108 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Vergil left a handsome property. On his death-bed he
requested to have 1118 “AEneid '² destroyed, on the ground
that he had not been allowed by the state of his health
to polish it as he desired. But fortunately his friends
disregarded his request, and very shortly after his death
it was published and immediately became a text-book for
Roman boys. Partly on account of the name of 1118
mother, Maia, 3116 partly because of the prophetie ten-
dency of 1118 eclogue addressed to Pollio, Vergil came to
be regarded as a herald of Christianity, and during the
Middle Ages acquired a marvellous reputation as a necro-
mancer. By Dante 110 was chosen as guide through Hel]
3116 Purgatory. Vergil’s writings are marked by exquisite
polish and delicacy of style3 his wide learning enabled
him to introduce many brilliant episodes into his poemS,
but often at the expense of originality. He borrowed
largely from the Greeks, notably Homer 3116 Apollonius
Rhodius; but in spite of all 110 18 regarded as the best
3116 1101110813 of the Roman poets.

THE BUCOLICS.

ECLOGUE Ι.

Meliboeus. Stretcht in the shadow of the broad beech,
thou
Rehearsest, Tityrus, on the slender pipe
Thy woodland music. We our fatherland
Are leaving, we must shun the fields we love:
While, Tityrus, thou, at ease amidthe shade,
Bidd'st answering woods call Amaryllis “ fair.''
Tityrus O Meliboeus! 'T 18 3 god that made
For me this holiday: for god Ι 'll aye
Account him; many a young lamb from my fold
Shall stain his altar. Thanks to him, my kine
Range, as thou seest them ε thanks to him, Ι play
What songs I list upon my shepherd's pipe.
Meli-boeua For me, Ι grudge thee not3 I marvel
much:
So 8010 3 trouble is in all the land.
Lo! feeble I am driving hence my goats—
Nay draqqinq, TityruS, one, and that with pain.
