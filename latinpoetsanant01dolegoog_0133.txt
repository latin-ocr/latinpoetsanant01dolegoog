THE BUCOLICS. 109

For, yeaning here amidst the hazel-stemS,
She left 1151· twin kids —on 1115 naked flint
She left them3 and Ι 1051 my promised flook.
This evil, Ι remember, ostentimeS,

WVas e'en like 11115 of 01115, where week by week
We Shepherds journey with our weanling flookS.
So whelp 10 dog, 50 kid (1 knew) 10 dam

But o’er all 511155 11115 50 lifts her head,

Meliboeus What made 11155 111511 50 keen 10 look on
Rome?
Tetyrus. Freedom: who marked, at last, my helpless
state:
Now that a whiter beard than that of y ore
Fell from my razor: still she ma1·,ked and came
