112 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Compose it —whioh Damoetas gave me onoe.

Dying he said, ‘ At last 't is all thine own!

The 1001 Amyntas heard, and grudged, the praise.

Two 1611116 1110160161· (perilous was the gorge

Downkwhioh Ι traoked 11161111) — dappled still each
6 111 -

Drain daily two ewe-udders; all for thee. .

Long Thestylis has oried to make them hers.

Hers be they — since to thee my gifts are (11066.

Β6 1111116, 011 16116611 8661 101 thee the Nymphs

Bear baskets lily-laden: Naiads bright

For thee orop poppy-orests and violets pale,

With daffodil and fragrant fennel-bloom:

Then, weaving casia in and all sweet 11111136,

8011 hyacinth paint with yellow marigold.

Apples I 'll bring thee, hoar wit-h tender bloom,

And ohestnuts — which my Amaryllis loved, ·

And waxen plums: let plums 100 11616 111611 day.

And thee Ι ’11 pluok, oh bay, and, myrtle, thee

Its neighbour: neighboured thus your sweets shall mix.

—Poohl Thou’rt a yokel, Corydon. Thy love

Laughs at thy· gifts: if gifts must win 15116 day,

Rich is Iolas. What thing have Ι, ·

Poor Ι, 116611 asking—-while the winds and boars

Rau riot in my pools and o’er my flowers ⁸?

—Yet, fool, whom fliest 1511011 ⁴? Gods have dwelt in
woodS,

And Dardan Paris. Citadels 1615 her .

’ Who built them, Pallas, haunt: green woods for me.

Grim lions 11111115 1116 11011, and wolves the kid,

And kids 615 play the clover-bloom. Ι 11111115

Τ1166 only: eaoh 0116 drawn 150 111161 116 loves.

8661 116111113 110111 111611 neoks the kine bring home

The plough, and, as he sinks, the 61111 draws out

To twice their 16113111 1116 shadows. — Still Ι 1111111

With love. For what 0611 end or alter love ? '²

Thou 'rt raving, simply raving, Corydon.
Clings to thy leafy elm thy half-pruned vine.
Why not begin, at least, to plait with twigs
And limber reeds some useful homely thing?
Thou ’11 find another love, if soorned by this·
