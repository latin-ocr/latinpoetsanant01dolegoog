ECLOGUE IV.

Muses of Sicily, a loftier song
Wake we! Some 1110 of shrubs and myrtles low.
Are woods our theme ? Then princel y be the woods.

Come are 111080 1881 days 131181 1110 Sybil sang:
The ages' mighty march begins anew.
Now comes the virgin, 88111111 1013118 838111; ,
Now from high heaven descends a wondrous race.
Thou on 1110 newborn babe - who first shall 01111
Τ11813 830 of iron, bid a golden dawn
Upon 1110 broad world — 0118810 Lucina, smile:
Now thy Apollo reigns. And, Pollio, 111011
811811 be our Princo, when he 11181 grander age
OpenS, and onward roll 1110 mighty moons:
Thon, trampling 0111 what prints our crimes have left,
811811 free 1110 118110118 from perpetual fear.
While he 10 111188 shall waken3 with 1110 1310813
800 1110 Brave 111111311113, and be seen of 1110111,
Ruling 11181 world o'er which his father's arm shed peace. —

On 11100, child, everywhere shall earth, untilled,
Shower, her first, baby-offerings, 1183181113 8101118
Of ivy, foxglove, 81111 gay briar, and bean 3«
Unbid 1110 30818 shall come big-uddered home,
Nor 1110118110118 110118 80810 the herded kine.
Thy cradle shall be full of pretty flowers:
Die 1111181 1110 serpent, treacherous poison-planbs
Μ1181 111ος 81111 Syria's roses spring like weedS.

But, soon as thou 081181 read of hero-deeds
Such as thy father wrought, and understand
What is 11110 worth: the champaign day by day
