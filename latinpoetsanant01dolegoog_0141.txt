THE BUCOLIC'S. 117

Shall grow more yellow with the waving corn3
From the wild bramble purpling then shall hang
The grape3 and stubborn oaks drop honeydew.
Yet traces of that guile of elder days
Shall linget-3 hidding men tempt 3003 111 3111113,
Gird towns with walls, cleave furrows in the land.
Then a new Tiphys shall arise, to man
New argosies with heroes: then shall be
New wars3 and once more shall be bound for Troy,
A mightier Achilles.

After this,
When thou 11031 grown and strengthened into man,
The pilot’s self shall range the seas no more;
Nor, each land teeming with the wealth of all,
The fioating pines exchange their merchandise.
Vines shall not need the pruning-hook, nor earth
The harrow: ploughmen shall unyoke their steers.
Nor then need wool be taught to counterfeit
This 11110 and that. At will the meadow ram
Shall change to saffron, or the gorgeous tints
Of Tyre, his fair fleece3 and the grazing lamb
At will put crimson on.

So grand an age

Did those three Sisters bid their spindles spin3
Three, telling with one voice 1110 011οη301033 will of Fate.

Oh draw — the time is all but present — near

To thy great glory, cherisht child of heaven,

J ove’s mighty progeny 1 And lo! the world,

The round and ponderous world, bows down to thee3
The earth, the ocean-tracts, the depths of heaven.
Lol nature revels in the coming age.

Oh 1 may the evening of my days last on,

May breath be mine, till Ι 110νο told thy deeds!

Not Orpheus then, not Linus, shall out-sing

Me: though each vaunts his mother or his sire,
Calliopea 11113, „Apollo that.

Let Pan strive with me, Arcady his judge3

Pan, Arcady his judge, shall yield the palm.

Learn, tiny babe, to read a mother's smile:

Already ten long months have wearied her.

Learn, tiny babe. Him, who ne’er knew such smiles,
Nor god nor goddess bids to board or bed.
