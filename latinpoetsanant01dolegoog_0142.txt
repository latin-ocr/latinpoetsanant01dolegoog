EOLOGUE V.

Menalcas, MopsuS, suppose, now two good men have
met—
You at flute-blowing, as at verses Ι ——
We 311 down here, where elm and hazel mix.
Mopsus, Menalcas, meet it is that Ι obey
Mine elder. Lead, or into shade— that shifts
At the wind's fancy — or (mayhap the best)
. Into some cave. See here ’s a cave, o'er which
A wild vine flings her fliinsy foliage.
Menalcas, On these hills one—Amyntas—vies with
you. y
Mopsus. Suppose he thought to outsing Phoebus' sels ’.Ρ
’ Menalcas. Mopsus, begin. If -aught you know of flames
That Phyllis kindles3 6118111 of Alcon’s worth,
Or Codrus's ill-temper3 then begin:
Tityrus meanwhile will watch the grazing kids,
Mopsus. Ay, Ι will sing the song which t' other day
On a green beech's bark I cut3 and scored
The music, as Ι wrote. Hear that, and bid
Amyntas vie with me.
Menalcas. As willow lithe
Yields to pale olive3 as to 6111113011 beds
Of roses yields the lowly l'avender3
So, 10 my mind, Amyntas yields to you.
Mopsus. But, lad, no more: we are within the cave.

[Sinqs] The Nymphs wept Daphnis, slain by 1111111633
666111.

, Ῡ6, 31166613 666 1162613, were their witnesses ε

When, clasping tight her son's unhappy corpse,

“ RuthleSS,” the mother cried, “ are gods and 31613.”

N one 10 1116 6001 brooks led in 611 111036 dayS,

Daphnis, his fed fiocks: no four-footed thing

Stoopt 10 1116 pool, or cropt the meadow·graSS.

How lions of the desert mourned thy death,

Forest's and mountains wild proclaim aloud.

'T was Daphnis taught mankind to yoke in cars

The tiger; lead the winegod's revel on,

And round the tough spear twine the bending leaf. Δ

Vines are the green wood's glory, grapes 1116 vine's:

The bull the cattle's, and the rich land's corn,
