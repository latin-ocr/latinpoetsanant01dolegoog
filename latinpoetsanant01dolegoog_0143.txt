THE BUCOLICS. · 119

Thou 311 thy people² s. When thou 1110131 thy doom,
Both Pales and Apollo left, our fields.

In furrows where we dropt big barley seeds,

Spring now rank darnel and the barren reed:

Not violet soff, and shining daffodil,

But thistles rear themselveS, and sharp—spiked 1110111.
Shepherds, strow earth with leaves, and hang 1110 springs
With darkness! Daphnis asks of you such 11103· .

“ Famed in 1110 green woodS‚ famed beyond 1110 311103,
A fair flock²s fairer lord, here Daphnis lies.²²

Menalcas. Welcome thy song 10 1110, 011 sacred bard,
As, 10 1110 weary, sleep upon 1110 grass:
As, in the summer-heah, a bubbling spring
Of sweetest water, 11131 shall slake our 1111131.
111 song, as on the pipe, thy master's match,
Thou, gifted lad, shall: now our 11133101 be.
Yet will I sing in 111111, 111 my poor way,
My song, and raise thy Daphnis 10 11ιο 31313 -
Raise Daphnis 10 1110 31313. Ηο loved' me 100.
Mopsus. Could aught in my eyes such a boon 0111-

Song- worthy was thy 1110111οε and Stimichon
Told me long since of 11131 331110 lay of 1111110.
Μεφιιέἱῐοαε [sinys] Heaven² s unfamiliar floor‚ and clouds
an 31313,
Fair DaphniS, wondering‚ sees beneath his feet.
Therefore gay revelries fill wood and field,
Pan, and 1110 shepherdS, and 1110 Dryad mai'ds.
Wolves plot 1101 1131111 10 sheep, nor 11013 10 deer3
Because kind Daphnis makes 11 holiday.
The unshorn mountains fling their jubilant voice
Up 10 1110 stars: 1110 crags and copses 3110111
Aloud, “A god, MenalcaS, lo! a god.²²
Oh! be thou kind and good 111110 1111110 own!
Behold four 311313, Daphnis: two for 11100, ,
Two, piled for Phoebus.The1eupon Ι ²ll place
Two cups, with new milk foaming‚ year by yea1·;
Two goblets filled with 11011031 olive-oil:
And, first with much wine making glad 1110 feast —
At the fireside 111 snowtime, ’1103111 1110 11003
In harvest— pour, rare nectar, from 1110 0311
