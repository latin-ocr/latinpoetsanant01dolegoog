120 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

The wines of Chios. Lyctian AEgon then

Shall sing me songS, and to Damoetas' pipe
Alphesiboeus danee his Satyrdanee.

And this 811311 111011 13611 never : when we pay

The Nymphs our vows, and when we oleanse the fields.
While boars haunt mountain-heights, and fishes streame,
Bees feed 011 thyme, and grasshoppers 011 dew,

Thy name, thyneedS, thy glory shall abide.

As Bacchus and as Ceres, so shalt thou

Year after year the shepherd's vows receive3

So bind him to the letter of his vow.

Mopsus. What 6311 Ι give thee, what, for such a song ⁴?
Less sweet to me the coming South-wind's sigh,
The sea-wave breaking on the shore, the noise
Of rivers, rushing through the stony vales·

Menalcas, First I shall offer you this brittle pipe.
This taught me how 10 sing, “ For one fair faee ε ”
Τ1118 taught me ‘⁶ Whose flook ? Meliboeus's ἱ) ”

Mopsus, Take thou 11118 61001( ; which oft Antigenes
Asked - and he then was lovable— in vain 3
Brass-tipt and even-knotted — beautiful!

ECLOGUE VI.

My muse first stoopt 10 trifle, like the Greek'S,
In numbers3 and, unblushing, dwelt in woodS.
Ι sang embattled kings: but Cynthius plueked
My ear, and warned me: “ Tityrus, fat should be
A shepherd's wethers, but his lays thin-d1·awn.''
So —‘-for enough and more will strive to tell,
Varus, thy deedS, and pile up grisly wars —-
On pipe of straw will I my wood—notes sing:
Ι sing not all unbid. Yet oh! should one
Smit by great love, should one read this my lay——
Τ11611 with thee, Varus, shall our myrtlegroves,
And all these eopseS, ring. Right dearly loves
Phoebus the page that opens with thy name.

On, sisters!

—- Chromis and Mnasylus saw
(Two lads) Silenus in a eave asleep:
As usual, swoln with yesterday’s debaueh.
