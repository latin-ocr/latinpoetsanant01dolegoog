J 11813 where 113 fell his gai-land. lay hard by 3

And on worn handle hung his ponderous can.
They -for 13116 old man oft had cheated each

Of promisi: songs — draw near, and make his wreaths
Fetters 10 bind him. AEgle makes a third,

(AEgle, 1116 loveliest of 1116 Naiad maidS,)

To back their fears: and, as his eyes unclose,
Paints brow and 136111 ples red with mulberry.

He, laughing 61 13116 trick, 61168, “ Wherefore weave
These fetters ? Lads, unbind me: ’1 18 enough
But 10 have seemed 10 have me in your power.

Till on an awed world dawned 1116 wondrous sun,
And straight from heaven, by clouds unbroken, fell
The showers: as woods 11181 bourgeoned, here and. there

To find the ploughman’s gear about her neck,
And felt on her smooth brow for budding horns.
