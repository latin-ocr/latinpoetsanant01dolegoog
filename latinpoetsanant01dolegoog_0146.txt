He under some dark oak— his snowy side

Cushioned on hyacinths— chews the pale· -green grase„

Or woos so'me favourite from the herd. “,Close NymphS,
Dictaean Nymphs, oh close the forest-gladesl

If a bull's random footprints by some chance

Should greet me! Lured, may be, by greener graSS,

· Or in the herd's wake following, vagrani: kine

- Τ11011 sings he of that mai-d who paused to gaze
At the charmed apples : — and surrounds with 111033,
Bitter 1100-111033, 1110 daughters of the 81111,

All songs which one day Phoebus sang 10 01131111οᾶ
Eurotas —- and the laurels learnt them off —

And journeyed all unwelcome up the sky.
