THE BUCOLICS. 123

Of teeming goats — together: herdsmen both,

Both in life's spring, and able well to sing,

Or, challenged, to reply. To that same spot

I, guarding my young myrtles from the frost‚

Find my goat strayed, the patriarch of the herd

, Α11(1 straight spy Daphnis. He, espying me

In turn, crieS, “ Meliboeus! hither, quickl

Thy goat, and kids, are safe. And if thou hast

An hour to spare, sit down beneath the shade.

Hither unbid will troop across the leas

The kine to drink: green Mincius fringes here

His banks with delicate bulrush, and a noise

Of wild bees rises from the sacred oak.”

What could I do ἱ) Alcippe I had none,

Nor Phyllis, to shut up my new-weaned lambs:

Then, there was war on foot —a mighty war—

Thyrsis ‘and Corydon 1- So in the end

I made my business wait upon their sport. —

So singing verse for verse—that well the Muse

Might mark it — they began their singing-match.

Thus Corydon, thus Thyrsis sang in turn.

(They si‘ny.)

Corydon. “ Ye¹ Fountain Nymphs, my loves! Grant
me to sing

Like Codrus: —next Apollo’s rank his lines: -

Or here—if all may scarce do everything
I 'll hang my pipe up on these sacred pinesss'

Thyo- 32⁸3. “Swains. 1 6 new minstrel deck with 1vy now,
Till Codrus burst with envy! Or, should he
Flatter 0 ’·,6111111011 twine foxglove o' er my brow,
Lest his knave' s· fiattery spoil the bard to 106.”
Corydon. “ ‘To Dian, from young Micon: this boar’s
head,
And these broad antlers of a veteran buck.'

Full-length in marble — ankle-bound with red
Buskins —I 'll rear her, should to-day bring luck.''
Thyrsis “ Ask but this bowl, Priapus, and this cake
Each year: for poor the garden thou dost keep.

Our small means made thee marble: whom we 'll make
Of gold, should lambing multiply our sheep.''
Corydon. “ Maid of the seas! more sweet than Hybla's

th me,
Grac{ful as ivy, white as is the swan!
