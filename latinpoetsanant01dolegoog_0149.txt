THE BUCOLICS. 125

Rivers turn back and listen — sing we next:
Alphesiboeus's and Damon's muse.

Winn'st thou the orags of great Timavus now,

Or skirtest strands where break Illyrian 8638 ⁴?

Ι know not. But oh when shall that day dawn
When I may 1611 thy deeds ¹? give earth thy layS,
That match alone the pomp of Sophocles?

With thee began, with thee shall end, my song:
110061113- what thou didst ask3 and round thy brow
Twine this poor ivy with thy vietor bayS.

’Τ was at the hour when night's oold shadow soaroe
Had left the skies3 when, blest by herdsmen, hangs
The dewdrop on the grass3 that Damon leaned

On his smooth olive-staff, and thus began.

‘⁶ Wake, morning star 1 Prevent warm day, and come!
While, duped and hnmbled, I—because I loved

Nisa with all 3 111181)311(1’8 love —oomplain3

And 6311 the godS, (though naught their cognizanoe
Availed,) at my last honr, a dying man.

” Begin, my flute, a song of Arcady!

“ There forests murmur aye, and pines discourse3
And lovelorn swainS, and Pan, who first reolaimed
From idleness the reed, hat-‚h audience there,
Regin, my flute, 3 song of Aroady!

“ N isa—is aught impossible in love ⁴?—

Ι 8 given to Mopsus Griffins next will mate

With mares: our children 866 1116 ooward deer

Come with the hound 10 drink. Go, shape the toi-eh,
Mopsus! fiing, bridegroom, nuts 1 Thou lead'st 3 wife
Home, and o'er OEta peers the evening star.

Begin, my flute, 3 song of Aroady!

“ Oh, mated with 3 worthy husband! thou

Who seorn'st mankind— abhorr’st this pipe, these goats
Of mine, and shaggy brows, and hanging heard:

Nor think’st that gods can see what mortals do!

Begin, my flute, 3 song of Arcady!
