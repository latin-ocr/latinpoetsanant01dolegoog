126 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

“ Within our orchard-walls Ι saw thee first,

A wee child with her 111011161- (Ι was sent

To guide you) — gathering apples wet with dew.
Ten years and one Ι scarce had numbered then3
Could scarce on tiptoe reach 1116 11111116 boughS.
Ι saw, Ι fell, Ι was myself no more.

Regin, my 111116, 6 song of Arcadyl

“ Now know Ι what love isl On hard rocks born
Tmaros, or Rhodope, or they who dwell

In utmost Africa do father him3

No child of 11101161 blood or lineage.

Regin, my 111116, 6 song of Arcady l

“ In her son’s blood a mother dipt her hands
At fierce love’s bidding. Hard was 1161· 116611 100-

· Which harder ? her 116611 01 11161 knavish boy's ἱ)

Knavish the boy, and hard was her 116611 too,
Begin, my 111116, 6 song of Arcadyl

“ Now 161 1116 wolf first turn and fly 1116 sheep:
Hard oaks bear golden apples: daffodil

Bloom on 1116 alder: and from myrtle·stems
Ooze richest amber. Let owls vie with swans;
And be as Orpheus — Orpheus in 1116 1110οἀ5, .
Arion with 1116 dolphins —every swain,
(Begin, my flute, a song of Arcady 1)

· “ And earth become mid ocean. Woods‚ farewelll

Down from some breezy mountain height, 10 1116 wave's
Ι 'll fiing me. Take this last gift ere Ι die.
Unlearn‚ my flute‚ 1116 songs of Arcady 1 ''

Thus Damon. How 1116 other made reply
Sing, sisterS. Scarce may all do everything.

Alphesiboeus, “ Fetch water: wreathe yon altar with
And Sgiff-nviilllli:vei-vain and brave frankincense3
That Ι may try my lord's clear sense 10 wat-p .
With dark 11168. Naught is lacking save 1116 songS.

Bring‚ songS‚ bring Daphnis from the city home!
