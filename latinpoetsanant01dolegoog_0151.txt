THE BUCOLICS. 127

’ “ Songs can bring down the very moon from heaven.
Circe with songs transformed Ulysses’ crew‚

Songs shall in sunder burst the cold grass-snake.
Bring, 501185, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“Three threads about thee, 01 111100 several 111105,
Ι twine3 and thrice — (odd numbers please the god) — Α
Cari-y thy image round the altar—stones.

Bring, songs, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“ Weave Amaryllis, in three knots three hues.
Just weave and say ‘ Ι 'm weaving chains 01 love.'
Bring, songs, bring Daphnis from the city home!

Α1111 1110 531110 fiame: so Daphnis 'neath my love.
Strew meal, and light with pitch the crackling bay.
Daphnis burns me3 for Daphnis burn 111050 bays.
Bring, 501185, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“ Be his 511011 longing as 1110 1101101 10015,

When, faint with secking her 1051 111310 1111011811 copse
And deepest grove, beside some water-brook

In the 810011 grass 5110 5111115 111 1101 despair,

Nor cares 10 yield possession 10 1110 night,

Be 1115 such longing: mine no Wish 10 heal.

“ Pledges 01 love, these 01011105 1110 1131101 01100
· Bequeathed me. I commit them, Earth, 10 11100

Bring, songs, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“ These deadly plants great Moeris gave 10 1110,
111 Pontus, plucked: in Pontus thousands grow.
By their aid have 1 seen him skulk in woods

A wolf, unsepulchre the buried dead,

And 01131111 10 011101 fields the standing corn.
Bring, 501185, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“ Go, Amaryllis, ashes in thy hand:
Thi-ow them —- and look not backwards —- o'er thy head
Into 3 running stream. These next I 'll try
