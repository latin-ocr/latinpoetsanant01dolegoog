128 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

On Daphnis3 who regards not gods nor songs.
Bring, 801138, bring Daphnis from the city home!

“ See! While I hesitate‚ a quivering flame

Hath clutched the wood‚ self-issuing from the ash.

May this mean good! Something—for Hylas too

Barks at the gate —it must mean. Is it true ?

Or are we lovers dupes of our own dreams ?

Ceaspl, 801138, 66686. Daphnis comes from the city
ome Ξ ”

ECLOGUE Ix.

Lycidas, Moeris, on foot ⁴? and 011 the road to town ⁶?-
MoeriS. Oh Lycidas l—we live to tell —how one—-
(Who dreamed of this ‘?) —a stranger —holds our farm,

And sayS‚ “ 'T is mine: its ancient lordS‚ begone Ξ ”
Beaten, cast down—for Chance is lord of all —
We send him ——bootlessly mayhap —- these kids.
Lycidas, Yet all, I heard, from where we lose yon 111118,
With gradual bend down-sloping to the brook,
And those old beeches‚ broken columns now,
Had your Menalcas rescued by his 801138.
Moeris.l Thou 116616815. Fame said 80. But our songs
avai ,
Moeris, no more mid warspears than, they say,
Dodona's doves may, when 15116 66316 stoops.
A boding raven from a rifted oak
Warned 1116, by this means or by that 150 nip
This strange strife in the bud: or dead were now

’ Thy Moeris3 dead were great Menalcas 1500.

Lycidas Could such curse fall on man? Had we so
near
Lost 151166, Μ61161668, 6116 thy pleasantries ?
Who then would sing 15116 nymphs? Who strow with
flowers ‚
The ground, or train green darkness o'cr the springs ἵ
And oh! that song, which Ι (saying ne’er a word)
Copied one day - (while thou wert off to see
‘My dar-ling, Amaryllis‚) — from thy notes:
“ Feed‚ while Ι journey but 6 few short stepS,
Tityrus, my goats: and Tityrus, when they ’ve fed,
Lead them to drink ε 6116 cross not by the way
The he-goat's path: his 1101118 are dangerous.''
