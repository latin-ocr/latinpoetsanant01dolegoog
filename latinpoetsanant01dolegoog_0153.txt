THE BUCOLIC'S. 129

Moerz‘s, But that to Varus, that unfinished 01101
“Varus Σ thy name, if Mantua still be ours—
(Mantual to poor Cremona all too near,) -—-

Shall 1111101111 swans exalt unto the stars.”

Lycidas Regin, if in thee ’8 aught. So may not yews
Ο1 Cyrnus lure thy bees: 80, clover-fed,

Thy cattle teem with milk. Me too the muse
Hath made a minstrel: Ι have songs; and me
The swains call “poet'' But Ι ,110οᾶ them not.
For scarce yet sing Ι 08 1110 great ones sing,
But, a goose‚ cackle among piping swanS.

Moeris, Indeed, Ι am busy turning o’er and o'er—

In hopes to recollect it—-in my 1110111
A'song‚ and not a mean 000, Lycidas.
“ Come, Galatea! sport’st thou 111 1110 waves ?
Here spring is purpling ; , thick by river-banks
Bloom the gay flowers3 white poplar climbs above
The caveS, and young vines plait a 1001 between.
Come! and let mad 8008 11001 against the shore Ξ ”

Lycidas, What were those lines that once Ι heard thee

Slng² .
All uncompanioned on a summer night—
1 know 1110 music, 11 Ι 11οᾶ 1110 wordS.
Moeris, “ Daphnis! why watch those old-world planets
1180 ?
Lo! onward marches sacred Caesar's star,
The star that made the valleys laugh with corn,
And grapes grow ruddier upon sunny hills.
Sow‚ DaphniS‚ pears‚ whereof thy sons shall eat.''
—Time carries all —our memories e'en—away.
Well Ι remember how my boyish songs
Would 011 01111081 1110 livelong summer day.
And now they ’10 011 forgot. His very voice
Hath Moeris lost: on Moeris wolves have looked.
—But 011 111011 ’11 hear 1110111 110111 Menalcas yet.

Lycidas, Thy pleas but draw my passion out. And 101
All husht 10 118100 18 1110 wide sea-floor‚

And laid the murmurings 01 1110 soughing windS.
And now we ’10 half-way there. Ι 000 descry
Bianor's grave. Here, Moeris, where the swains
Are raking off the thick leaveS‚ let us sing.

Or, 11 we fear lest night meanwhile bring up
The rain cloud-5, singing let us journey on
