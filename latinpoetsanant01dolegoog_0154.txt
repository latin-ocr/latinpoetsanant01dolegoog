(The way will seem less tedious) — journey on
Singing: and Ι will ease thee of thy load.

Moeris. Cease, 16111 We 'll do what lies before us now:
Then sing our best, when comes the Master home.

ECLOGUE X.

Gallae. Oh Arethuse, let this last task be mine!
One song—a song Lycoris’ 8611 may read-
My Gallus asks : who ’d grudge one song to him ?
Sc, when thou slidest 'neath Sicilian 8668,
May ne'er salt Doris mix her stream with thine:
Begin: and sing—while yon blunt muzzles search
Τ116 underwood— 01 Gallus torn by love. ,
We lack not audienoe: woods take up the notes.
Where were ye, Naiad Nymphs, 111 grove or glen,
When Gallus died of unrequited love ? ·

Apollo came: 61111, “Art thou mad,'' he saith,
“ Gallus ἱ) Thy love, through bristling camps and snOWS,
Tracks now another's steps.'’ Silvanus came,
Crowned with his woodland glories: to 61111 fro
Rocked. the great lilios and the fennel bloom.
Pan came, Arcadia's Pan: (I have seen him, red
With elder-berries 61111 with cinnabar z)
“Is there no end ⁴? ’' quoth he: “ Love heeds not this:
Tears sate not cruel Love: nor rills the 1668,
Nor the bees clover, nor green boughs the goat.''
But he rejoins sad-faceti: “ Yet sing this song
Upon your hills, Arcadians! 'none but ye
