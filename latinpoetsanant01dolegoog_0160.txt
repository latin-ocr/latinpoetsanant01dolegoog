THE DEAD OX.

“Tfflz Gnonmcsst

Lo! smoking 111 15116 stubborn plough, the ox
Faus, from his lip foam gushing orimson- stained,
And sobs his life out. Sad of face the ploughman
MoveS, disentangling from his comrade' s 001 pse
The lone survivor: and its work half-done,
Abandoned in the furrow stands the plough.

Not shadiest forest-depths‚ not: softest lawnS,

May move him now: 11015 river amber-pure,

That tumbles o'er the oragstones to 15116 plain.
Powerless the broad sides, glazed ‘che rayless eye,
And low and lower sinks 15116 ponderous neck.
What thank hath he for all the toil he toiled‚

The heavy-olodded. land in man's behoof
Upturning ? Yet. 15116 grape of Italy,

The stored-up feast 1131511 wrought no harm to him ε
Green leaf and taintless grass are all their fare3
The clear rill o'r 15116 travel-freshened stream

Their cup': nor one care mars their honest, sleep.
