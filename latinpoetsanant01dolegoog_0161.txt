ARRIVAL oF AENEAS AT CARTHAGE. 137

Troys walls she for her much lou'd Arqos bore:

Old seeds of wrath‚ and. bitter griefe‚ infest

As yet her mind: deepe rooted in 1161· brest

Was Paris Iudgement, and the iniury

Of her despised forme3 His kindred high

In her distast3 and Ioue-rapt Ganimed

To honours rais'd: 1161· flame this fuel] fed.

Who farre from Latium droue the Troiam, tost

On Seaes 3 poore ReliqueS, which the Grec-ian Hoast
And dire Achilles fury left vnslaine:

Wandring through all 'ch' vnhospi‘cable maine

For many winter& driven by force of Fato.

A worke so great to raise the Roman state.

Sz’cilia yet in sight, they hoise 111611· 861163,

And plough the foming brine with prosperous gailes:
When Iuno, who in rancled bosome bare

And yeild. my selfe as vanquisht ‘? Cannot Ι

This Troz'an Princo devort from Italy ?

Because the Faces forbid. Could Pallas fier

The Grecian Fleete‚ and drowne them in her ire,

For one mans sin3 Oileus rapefull 10116 ’.Ρ

She horrid lightning from the clouds of Ioue ·
Flung on their shippes‚ and seas with stol-mes vp-turnd:

And in the hollow mountaine lowdly rore.

Great AEoluS, thron²d in a lofty 'nowen

With soepter calmes their rago, and curbes their power3
Else Sea, Earth, and high hoamen, that heady throng
Would sweepe away, and hurry all along.

Almighty Ioue, this soal-ing, these inolos'd

In pitohy caue83 high hills thereon impos'd:

And gano a King, who knew how to 1631161116,

To calme their strife, and when to gine the reine.
