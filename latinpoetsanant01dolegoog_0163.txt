ARRIVAL OF AENEAS AT CARTHAGE. 139

To crushing fioodS, which in huge mountaines rose.

These on high billowes hang3 the yawning waues

Shew those their bottom 361168, 6116 troubled graues.

By Southwindes rapt, on 11166611 rocks three fall,

(Those fatall rocks th' Italicus Altars call)

The seas all-wracking Ridge: three Eurus spight

Droue on dire Syrts (a lamentable sight)

Bilgd on the flats, 111 quick-sands wrapt„ Before

His eyeS, a mighty Sea o're that which bore

Faithfull Orontes and his Lz'cz’ans flew

And from the Poope the Maister head-long threw:

Then in swift eddies turnes; thrice hurries round

The foundred vessell, in that whirlepit drownd.

Armes, planckS, and Troian riches, here and there

Flote on broad seaes. And now these tumults tere

I lienes strong ship3 the shippes which bold

Achates held 3 which Abas, which the old

Alethes bore: the hostil water breakes

Through all their ript-vp 86611163, 6116 springing leakes.
Neptune meane while perceiu'd. the sea to rore

With blustring 11111663, which from the bottome tore

The tost-vp waues, incenst‚ the cause suspects3

And o're 1116 flood his 366166 head erects.

There sees AEneas wretched fieet distrest:

His Troian friends by 8668 6116 skies 0991681.

Iuno's deceipt and 11616 1161 brother knew

Who Zephyrus and Eurus hales: Arc you

(8616 116) 80 confident in your high birth3

That dare, without our leaue, mix heauen with earth,

And with your tumults swell th' inraged. Seas ?

Which I — Yet first we will our floods appease:

N or shall like insolencies be forgot.

Fly timely hence3 6116. 1611 your King, the lot

Graue vs, not him, the empire of the DeepeS,

And this fear'd Trident. Ragged rocks hee keepes;

Euo-ue, your court: there let him domineare;

And o're th' incaued windes his Scepter beare.

Sooner then said, he calmes the boistrous maine3

Scatters the cloudes, the Sun restores againe.

Cymothoe, Tryton, now their force vnite3

Ships shoue from rocks, rais’d by his Tridents might:

He loosens'the vast Syrte, the surges raignes;

And rakes with nimble wheiles the liquid Ρ1611163.
