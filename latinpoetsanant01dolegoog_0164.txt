140 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

As when Sedition often flames among
A mighty People, the ignoble th'rong

To outrrage fall ε then stones aud fier-brands fly3
' Rage armes provides: when they by chance espy
One reverenst for his worth, all silent stay

With listening eares; whose graue pei-swasions sway,
And pacify their miudes: so when the rude
Tumultuous Seas their King and Father viewd,
Their fury fell. Who vnder clear’d-vp skies

With slack rein'd steeds on prosperous chari-iot flyeS.
Altering their course, the weary Tro‘z'ans sband

For nearest shores, and reach the Libyan strand.

Deepe in a Bay and Ile with sti-etchbout sides

A Harbor makes, and breakes the iustling tides:
The parting fioods into a land-lockt sound

Their streames discharge, with rocks invirond round:
Whereof tw0, equall lofty, threat the skyes3

Vnder whose leev the safe Sea silent lies:

Their browes with darke and trembling woods arayd
Whose spreading branches cast. a dreadfull shade.
Within the hanging rock a caue, well knowne

To sacred Sea-nymphS, bencht with living stone,

In fountaines fruitfull. Here no hauser bound
The shaken shipps, nor anchor broke the ground.
. Hether AEneas brought seuen ships (no more
VVere‘lefb of all) ; the much-desired shore

The Troicms now possesse ε who land in hasta,

And on the beach their Sea-sick bodies cast.

Then fier from flints Achates strikes: touch-wood
· The sparks receaueS, inlarg'd with flaming food.
Corne, in salt water drenchb, they spent and pin’d
In hast produce3 some parch on coles, some grind,
Meanwhile AEneczs climbes a steepe ascent3

And ·throws his eyes on all the seas extent,

In search of Pliryqian ships: for Anthus, chac't

In stoi-mes3 for Oap722'8‚· for the bright armes plac't
On Caicus high poope3 but none descry'd.

Three stragling staggs then on the shore espy'd,
Who all the heard, that followed sloly, led3

And now along the ranker vally fed.

His bow and quiver, which Achates bore,

In hast he snatcht3 and those 'chat stalkt before
(Their branched hornes alost advancing) slew:
