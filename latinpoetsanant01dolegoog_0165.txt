Then to the 0011011 they the rest pursew;

Nor left, till seauen lay bathed in their blood:

Or men possest: this seriously intends3
And to impart his knowledge to his friends,

And in 1118 1101111 two steele-tipt iauelins shooke.
His mother meets him in the silvan shade3
Arm'd and aoooutred like a Spartan Maid:
Or like the swift Harpal ice of Thrace ,·
Out-stripping steeds‚ andHebers heady Raoe.

In amarous windes her dangling tresses fiovv,

By Seas and tempests on 11118 country throwne:
