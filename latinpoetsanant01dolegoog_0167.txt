⁴ ARRIVAL OF AENEAS AT CARTHAGE. 143

On Lybian shores: AEneas is my name,

Who bring with me my rescu'd Gods; my fame

Surmountes the starres: now Italy, the place

From whence we sprung, we seeke3 Ioues sacred Race

Lost Phryqt‘a I with twenty ships forsooke3

And by my mother-Goddesse counsell, tooke

The way which fates prescrib'd: seauen, vnbereft

By seas, and cruell stormes‚ alone are left.

Vnknowne, distressed, on the Libyan wast

We stray3 from Asia and from Europ chast.
Venus the sad expressions of his hart

Thus gently interrupts ε What ere thou art,

Thou by the favour of the heavenly PowerS.

Surviu'st to see the C'athaqc'nian towers.

Goe on to Dido's Court: thy men againe

(anesse my skill in Augury be vaine)

And scattered sthS, thou shalt in safety find ;

Borne into harbor by the Northerne wind.

‚Twelue ioyful swans behold, late chased by

Ioues towring Eagle through the empty sky3

Which now in ordered files together light

On vnder earth; or thither bend their flight3

How freed from danger, sporting in a ring,

They clap their siluer wings, and ioyntly sing:

Even so those storme-chas'd ships in glad consort

Are entred', or now safely saile to Port.

Proceede‚ and tread that ready path. This said

In turning she her rosyneok displayd

Her tresses with Ambrosia dewd expire

A heauenly odor3 her inlarg’d attire

Trailes on the ground: her gate a goddesse showes,

He by these signes his flying Mother knowes3

And thus pursuews her: Art thou cruell growne ?

Why dost thoU, to deceaue thy son, put on

Such varied figures ἱ) Ο, why may not wee

onne hands, discourse, and seem the same we be.

Accusing thus, his way to Carthaqe holds:

Whom Venus in a dusky clowd infolds3

That none may see them in that gloomy mask‚

Hurt‚ hinder, or their cause of comming ask.

The pleased Queene to Paphos then retireS,

Where stood her Temples: there a hundred fiers

(Whose flagrant flames Sabeom gums devoures) ·
