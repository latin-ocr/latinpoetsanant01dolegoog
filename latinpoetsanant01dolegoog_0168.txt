144 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Blaze on as many 611613, orownd with flowers.
Meanewhile they bot-‚h 1116 11011611 path pursue‚

. And from a hill 1116 neighbouring Citty view:

That ample Pile (6 village 1616) they 111611

Admire3 1116 86166, 1116 6116616, and noise of men.
The Tyrion-3 ply their baskes: some bulwarks reare,
Strong walls extend, and 3101166 01 101116 01· beare ε
Some 36616 for houses ehoose, some lawes proieet,
Graue Magistrates and Senators 61661.

Η616 111666 611 ample Heuen dig3 111616 they

For lofty Theaters foundatious lay:

Others in quarries mighty Pillars hew, .

To grace the Spectaeles 11161 should ensew.
Industrious Bees so in 1116 prime of May

By sun-shine through 1116 flowry meddows stray,
When they produce their young, or 61016 111611 hiue
With liquid hony, or in eabins stiue

That pleasant Neetar: when they take 1116 106(13
Which others bring, or ohase from their aboads
The lazy drone3 1116 1101157 redolent

With flowers of thime: all 1101 011 labour 116111.

O happy you whose eitty ‘chus aspires.

(AEneas said) and 1161 high roofes admires.

With 11161 (0 wonderful 1) wrapt in a elowd‚
Invisible he mingles with 1116 crowd.

A shady grone amidst 1116 011151 stood:

Here Tyrz’ans 6131, when by 1116 raging flood

And furious tempests on 111066, boi-ders throwne‚
Dig'd vp a Horses head, by Izmo showne:

Which never-failing Plenty did fore-belh

And 11616 they should in glorious armes excell.
Here Tyrion Dido Iemo’s Temple plae⁷d3

In offerings 11611, by her faire statue grae⁷dz

The 6161163 of brasse, the beames with brasse were bound,
The brazen doores on grinding hinges sound. ·
The sights within this sumptuous Fane his feare
Did first asswage 3 and first AEneas here

Durst hope for safety, his sad spirits rais'd.
