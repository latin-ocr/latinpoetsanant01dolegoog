150 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Bough of a holm-oak green, ere race of the ships has
Yontlgrgglrile kind chief sets, as a sign for the mariner oar,
Wheuce to return and to sweep at a distance round to
'Dulyssklgr {nox-&eir places are chosen3 in purple and gold
High on the stern the commanders shine‚ all bright to
behold.
Poplar branches for garlands the joyous mariners twine‚
Bared ‘and anointed shoulders with glistening unguent
Benclielsf1 {re manned. All arms reach eagerIy, grasping
Heagzetgaglie signal strain. Through rioting pulses run
Thi-obbing sear and desire of immol-tal praise to be won.
Then at the ringing sound of the clm-ion, halting no
Eachmgffin the station suddenly bounds; shouts roll to
Undgffiffgsssw'ring of the shoulders the foam-flakes rapidly
Side il} side deep furrows are clowen, the great sea gapes‚
Rent to a chasm by the blades and the beaks with their
trident shapeS. ,
Not so swiftly the cars in the two-wheeled chariot racc
Scour the expanse of plain, stream forth from the barrier
Not ggassffinges the yoke, when the charioteer as he speeds
Tosses his flowing teins, and arising‚ lashes his steeds.

Thundering voices and loud applause from the wood-
Roll 1313} Stlllel (land-locked shores, from the mountains
Far &gaggrprzffl shoots GyaS‚ of crowd and of thunder
Glidiczigag'head on the water. Cloanthus follows in rear3
Better his service of σαι-8, but his vessel's ponderous size
Heavily stays him. Behind‚ at anequal interval, vies

Dragon with Centaur vast for the foremost lead on the
Nowb'gvis the Dragon hath it— the Centaur passes ‚her

now.
