160 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

&ravest in vain of the brave, wilt suffer a prize so great
Tamely without one blow to be borne by another away ?
Where is thine Eryx now, that master and god thy
Idly tgildgetllgimm thy glory that over Sicily rung ⁶? —

All thy trophies hanging around thy halls in array ⁶? ’⁹

“Loxfrie of renown and ambition,'' he answerS, “neither is
Feardfhdadis extinguisht neither, but lingering age makes
ea

This οῙΙιὲΠ blood, and my outworn strength grows iey and
eo .

Had I what once was mine, what makes yon blusterer
Vainbg}dhis powerS, were only my manhood still in its
Guegizlffln'one were needed, nor bulloek goodly in sooth,
Hither to draw me. Of gifts I reek but‘ lightly.” He
Into &thie midst, as he spake, two ponderous gauntlets
Whexrrgffvtsth fiery Eryx was used in the battle to stand,
Showering blow upon blow from his mighty and gaunt-
Men lgttggdhsaffgfit and awed at the seven huge hides of the
ΟΧΘΠῗΙ-ξζξουηᾶ and stiffened with masses of iron and
Dareheaiiiiinself is appalled‚ and declines them, standing
Evenaffigtheroiss son of Anchises balanees long,

Hither and thither turning, the measureless folds of
81οΨῗὲοἲἕέ old man spake with a breath deep drawn

from his heart ε

“ Ah 1 had ye looked on the gauntlets of Hercules, gazed
Armgd‚ts}‚h}ffoy(}onder on these sad shores that battle of
Eryxbfffoolld thy brother was harnest thus for the fray ;

Still with hrains and with gore thou seest they are
dabbled to-day.
