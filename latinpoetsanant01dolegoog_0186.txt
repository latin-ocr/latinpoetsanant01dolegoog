162 PUBLIUS VERGILIUS MARO.

Some tall town, or besieges a mountain fort with his train,
Every entrance tries, reconnoitres wisely the ground, ’
Often essays the assault, but essays it ever in vain.
Now Entellus his right hand showed as he rose to the
Shovfflgssr a moment, and struck, but his rapid enemy's
Saw (ityealready descenfflng, and, ere it lighted below,
Dares darted aside, and it past him hai-mlessly by.
Huge Entellus his strength on the vain wind wasted, and
Eartlliaegds heavilythundered by no man's stroke but his
So [1333] 'high Erymanthus, or Ida's mountain incline,
Hollow with age, comes crashing, at last uprooted, the
plne.

Trojans rise to behold, and the brave Trinacrians rise3
All with conflicting passions fired3—-shouts roll to the
FirstSldhezhe field of disaster the royal Acestes appearS,
Lifts from the earth with pity his comrade equal in years.
Undismayed, unabated, the hero now to the fight
Keener than ever returns; wild anger rouses his might:
Honour inspires him, and sense of a valour yet unrevealcd.
Furiously Dares he chases in hot flight over the field,
Now with his righthand leads, with his left hand now,
Ceasglllgsgttlarlii‘lz'sting ever. As hailstorms smiting the stack
Rattle on turret and roof, so rains Entellus his blow—
Plies both hands, drives hither and thither the buffeted
Furtlfffi the wise AEneas permits not fury to rage,
Leaves not fierce Entellus insatiate battle to wage,
Orders a truce forthwith, leads shattered Dares away
Far from the battle, and gently consoles him thus by the
‘c nifflfied bgavez what maaness, alas, thy wit has
