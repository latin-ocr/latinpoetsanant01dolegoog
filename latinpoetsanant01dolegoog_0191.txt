THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCfilISES. 167

Last, but before all others in beauty, Iulus of Troy,
Set on a Sidon steed which Dido lovely of yore Α
Grave him as token and pledge·of a love to endure ever-

Mou1131¹112cede on Sicily' s chargers the rest, and by Sicily' s
Ηοπεξῗξοῑι· the pageant. A cheer from the gathered Teu-
Breaffiffi {iliaegshy band enters. The scene with pleasure
Findfflilr‹13§th-J1 elxgoks of the children the fathers' faces anew.

After the joyous riders have made their round of the
Undglhssffigwes of the sires, Troy’ s herald, standing apart,
Shouts the expected signal, and lashes his thundering
Everghgggnpany gallops asunder, the three troops part
Into retii-ing halves 3 — at a sign each, suddenly, lo!
Wheels to the front, and, with weapons couched, bears
down on the foe.
Now once more they retire— ’ once more with the lance
Turnfflgss{ {netgssfiheir paces— the field to the enemy bar —
Circles alternate weave upon circles still incomplete‚ —
Waking with battle armour the shadowy image of war.
Backs now bare in retreat—now point their steel to the
Nowbgfiagsfft-t-moe and together are pacing‚ lances in rest.
Even as the sabled road in the Labyrinth olden of Crete
Ran through sunless walls and a thousand paths of deceit,
ΤΗΙ all· tracks for retracing the journey failed in a maze
Whence none came that had entered, for none found clew
So wtighltisnwvggesd paces the Trojan chivalry bright
Ride‚ and in sportive tangle involve gay battle and flight3
Like some dolphin shoal‚ that afloat on the watery plain
Cleaves Carpathia's billows and distant Libya’s main.

This {aff fashion of handling the steed‚ these trials of
