MANILIUS.

MANILIUS, Manlius, or Mallius was the author of an
astrological poem in five books entitled ‘⁴ Astronomica.”
He is supposed to have lived in the age of Augustus, but
nothing whatever is known about him. His style was
harsh and obscure, but offers some curicus details of
ancient scientific notione.

THE MILKY WAY.

Non will we hide what ancient Fame profest:

How milke which gusht from Iano's whiter brest

In heaven that splendent path and circle drew3

From whence the name, as erst the colour grew,

Or troopes of vnseene starres there ioyne their light3
And with vnited splendour shine more bright.

Or Soules of Heroe3‚ from their bodies freed,
Exchanging Earth for Heaven, (their vertues meede)
Shine in that Orbe, their proper place of rest3

And liue aetheriall liueS, of heauen possest.

— Translation os Gnonon SANDYS (1632).
