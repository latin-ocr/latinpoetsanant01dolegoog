QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

HonAcE, the most popular of all the Roman poets, was
born at Venusia, in Apulia, on the 8th of December, 65
13.c.' His father, formerly a slave, had been manumitted
before he was born, and occupied the unpopular calling
of tax-gatherer. From its profits he bought his farm in
the romantio region south of the River AufiduS, and was
enabled to give his talented son the best education then
possible. He took him to Rome, probably about the age
of twelve, and put him into the most fashionable schools;
one of his teacherS, Orbilius PupilluS, as notorious for
his severities in flogging as Dryden's Dr. Busby, is com-
memorated by Horace in his “ Epistles‚” where he is.called

tribune. He shared in the battle of Philippi, and the
disgraceful part which he, in common with the republican
army, took in running away after their defeat, was made
the subject of a playful allusion in the seventh ode of
the second book. He obtained pardon, returned to Rome,
and was appointed a clerk in the questor's office, where
he managed to live by great economy, his paternal estate
having been confiscated. Some of his poems attracted
the attention of Vergil and others, and he was introduced
to MaecenaS, the generous patron of literature. They
became intimate friends In 37 Horace accompanied
Maecenas on that famous journey to Brundisium so charm-
ingly described in the fifth satire. Three years later
Maecenas gave the poet a delightful little farm in the
valley of Ustica, about fifteen miles from Tibur—the
present town of Tivoli. This Sabinefarm, with its beau-
tiful situation and romantio scenery, is often mentioned
