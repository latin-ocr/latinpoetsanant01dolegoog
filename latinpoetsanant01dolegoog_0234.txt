during the latter years of his life when 113 was not at
Rome he was at one of these two places.

The first book of Horace’ s‘ ‘Satires'' appeared m 35.
Two years later 113 brought out 1113 second book of them.
He scores the follies of vice with keen wit, but without
lofty moral indignation. The‘ ‹J'Epodes in which he is
supposed to have got his inspiration from Archilochus, ap-
peared in the year 31. Seven or eight years later, when
he had passed his fortieth year, carne the three books
of‘ ‘.Odes '' Full of epigiainmatic and felicitous turns
of expression, they have always appealed· to the scholar.
His love poems are delicate aud graceful, but they have
no depth 01 passion or feeling. Horace never married.

The first book of his‘ ‘Epistles'' was published in 20
or 19, 311(1 with the second book, the date of which is
uncertain, are regarded as the most perfect remains of
Roman verse. Two years later came the‘ ‘Carmen Secu-

Horace' s philosophy rested on three general maxims in-
culcating moderatiori in all things, present content, and
courage in facing an unknown future. He was 01 gay
and buoyant disposition, but possessed of a fine dignity
and spirit of independence. His delightful personality
seems to breathe from his verses, and no poet ever lived
