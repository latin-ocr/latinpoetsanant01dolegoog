To AUGUSTUS CAESAR. 211

CIVIL WAR.
Epona VII.

WHITHER, O whither rush ye in fell wrath ?
Why fit the sheathed sword to red right hands ⁶?
Too little hath there yet of Thracian death
Orimsoned the scas and lands ⁴?

Not that the envious Punic citadel

Should fall in fire on Rome's victorious day,
Or the chained Briton‚ once invincible,

Move down the sacred way.

But that thou mayest the Parthian prayer fulfil,
A sels-destroying city. Not such mind ⁴

Have wolves or lions, such a thirst to kill;
They war not with their kind.

Doth some blind fury, or a spur more keen,
Urge you, or crime ⁶? I pray you, let me know.
None answers——their pale stupor may be seen3
Their stricken blood beats low.

This is it: evil bitter fates impel

Rome's children, the fraterna] murder's crime,
Our deep inheritance, since Remus fell,

Of curse unto all time.

Lest Pyrrha should again with plaintive eries
Behold the monsters of the deep arise, ·
When to the mountain summit Proteus drove

His searborn hercl, ancl where the woodland dove
