212 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

Late pereht, his wonted seat, the soaly brood
Entangled hung upon the topmost wood,

And every timorous native of the plain,

High floating, swam amid the boundless main.

We saw, pusht baokward. to his native source,
The yellow Tiber roll his rapid course3

With impious ruin threatening Vesta’s fane,
And the great monuments of Numa's reign3

With grief and rage while Ilia's bosom glow5,
Boas‘cful, for her revenge, his waters rose3

But now the uxorious river glides away,

So Jove oomniands, smooth-winding to the sea.

And yet, less numerous bytheir parents' orimeS,
Our sons shall hear, shall hear to latest timeS,

· of Roman arms with civil gore imbrued,
Which better h‘ad the Persian foe subdued.

Among her guardian gods, what pitying power
To raise her sinking state shall Rome implore ?
Shall her own hallowed virgins’ earnest prayer
Harmonious oharm offended Vesta's ear ἱ)

To whom shall Jove assign to purge away

The guilty deed'? Come, then, bright god of day,
But graoious veil thy shoulders‚ beamy bright,
Oh! veil in clouds the unsufferable light.

Or come, sweet queen of smileS, while round thee rove
On wanton wing, the powers of miri-,h and love3

Or hither, MarS, thine aspect graeious bend,

And, powerful, thy neglected raoe defend..

Parent of Rome, amidst the rage of fight

Sated with soenes of blood, thy fieree delight,

Thon, whom the polisht helm, the noise of arms
And‘the stern soldier's frown with transport warms:

Or thou, fair Maia's winged son, appear,
And human shape in prime of manhood wear;
Deolared. the guardian of the imperial state,

Divine avenger of great Caesar’s fate:
