TO THE SHIP BEARING VERGIL. 213

Oh l late return to heaven, and may thy reign
With lengthened blessings fill thy wide domainl
Nor let thy people's crimes provoke thy flight
On airy pinions to the realms of light.

Great prince and father of the state, receive

The noblest triumphs which thy Rome can give3
Nor let the Parthian with unpunished pride,
Beyond his boundS, Ο Caesar, dare to ride.

ΤΟ ΤΗΕ SHIP'BEARING VERGIL ΤΟ ATHENS.
Onn 111.‚ Boon Ι.

So may the Queen of Cyprian heightS,
So Helen's brethren, starry lights,
So speed thy course the Lord of wind,
And all, save Zephyr, fastly bind:

Ο Ship, thou hast a debt to pay,

Our Vergi13 hold him well, 1 pray,
Unharmed to Attio bounds consign,
And save that life, the half of mine.

’Τ was armed with oak and triple braSS,
His breast, who first made bold to pass
In fragile bark the truculent seas,

Nor feared the boding Hyades,

Nor southwest wind at war with north,
Nor headlong Notus blustering forth,
Like whom no= tyrant Adria sways

The tempest to allay or raise.

All forms of death will he defy

Who views rude waves with tearless eye,
Sea-monsterS, and thy deadly sweep,
Thou sheer Acroceraunian steep.
