214 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

of purpose Heaven by severing main
Divided lands; but all in vain

If rebel ship3, in Heaven's despite,
May leap the wave5‚ and lands unite.

For men, o'erbold to do and dare,
Right down the heavenly barriers tear,
And Japheffs raoe, portentous birth,
By guilty theft bring fire to earth. .

Thai: crime aohieved, a strange ari-ay

Of Fevem, and unknown Deoay, .
Swept down on man, and Death perforoe
Made speedier his appointed course.

The might of Hercules destroyed
Hell's bars, and in the airy void
With lawless wings, not given to man,

The flight of Daedalus began.

In naught, we think, ean mortale fail:
We seek, like fools, high heaven to scale3
With crime so rife, Jove cannot lay

The bolts, that speak his wrath, away.

CONQUER’D with soff. and pleasing Charms‚

And never-failing Vows of her Return,

Winter unlooks his frosty Arms

To free the joyful Spring3

Which foi· fresh Loves with youthful Heat does burn ;
Warm South-Winds court her, and with fruitful Showers
Awake the drowsie Flowers

, Who haste and all their Sweetness bring

To pay their yearly offering.
