QUINTUS HORA TIUS FLACCUS.

And he 11131 lives 1110 longesl: dies but young3
And once deprived of Light,

We 're wrapt in 1111818 of endless night.

Once come 10 111080 dark cells, of which we 're told
So many strange 1011131111οΚ Τ3108 of old

(In things unknown Invention 's justly bold),
No more shall Μ111311 and Wine

Our Loves and Wit refine.

No more shall you your Phyllis have,

Phyllis 80 long you 've prized3

Nay she 100 111 1110 Grave

Shall lye like us despised.

ΤΟ whom now, Pyrrha, 311 thou kind ⁴?
To what Heart-ravisht lover

Dost 111011 thy golden looks unbind‚
Thy hidden sweets discover,

And with large bounty open 801

All 13110 bright stores of thy rich cabinet ⁴?

Ah, simple youth, how oft will he
Of thy changed saith complain!
And 1118 own fol-tunes find 130 be
So airy and 80 vain:
Of 80 camelicn-like an hue,
Τ1131 81111 111011 colour changes with 11 1001

How oft, 3138, will he admire
The blackness of 13110 8111081

Trembling 130 11031 1110 winds sound higher,
‘And 800 1110 billows rise:

Poor unexperieneed he,

Who ne'er‚ 3138, before had been 31 8031

Ηο joys in thy calm sunshine now,
And no 11103111 stirring hears;
