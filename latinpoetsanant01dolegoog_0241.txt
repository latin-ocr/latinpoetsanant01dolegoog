To LYDIA. 217

In 1116 clear heaven of thy brow
No smallest cloud appears,
He sees 11166 gentle, fair, and gay,
And trusts 1116 1611111688 April of thy May.

Unhappyl Thrice unhappy‘ he,
T’ whom 111011 untried dost shine!
But there ’8 110 danger now for me,
Since o’er Loretto's shrine,
In witness of 1116 shipwreck past,
My consecrated vessel hange at last.

TO LYDIA.
0011 VIII„ Boon 1.

ENCHANTING Lydia! prithee‚
By all 1116 gods that see thee,
Pray tell me this: must Sybaris
Perish‚ enamoured with thee ⁶?
Lo! wrapt as in a 1131106, 116
Whose hardy youth could fancy
Each manly seat, dreads dust and heah,
‘ All through thy necromancy!

Why rides he never, 1611 us»,
Accoutred like his fellows,

For cui-band whip, and horsemanship,
And martial bearing zealous ⁴?
Why hangs he back, demurrent
To breast the Tiber's current,

From wrestlers' oil, as from the coil
Of poisonous snake, abhorrent ἱ)

No more with iron rigour
Rude armour-marks disfigure
His pliant, 11111118, 11111 languor dinis
His eye and wastes 1118 vigour.
Gone 18 1116 youth's ambition
To give the lance emission‚
Or hurl adroit 1116 circling queit
In gallant competition.
