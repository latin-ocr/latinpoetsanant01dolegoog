To THE SPRING OF BANDUSIA. 219

Seoure those Golden early Joys,

That Youth unshow' red with sorrow boam,
Ere withering Time the taste destroys‚
With Siokness and unwieldy Years!

For active SportS‚ for pleasing Rest‚

This is the time to be possest,

The Best is but in Season best.

The 'pointed Hour of promist Bliss,

The pleasing Whisper in the Dark,

The half unwilling willing Kiss,

That Laugh that guides thee to the Mark, “⁴'‘
When the kind Nymph wou⁷d Coyness feign,
And hides but to be found again,

These, these-are J oys the Gods for Youth ordain.

TO THE SPRING OF BANDUSIA.'
ona xm„ BOOK 111.

Ο BANDUsrAN Spring, olearer than elearest glasS,
-Wortfilzzvghg sweetest of wine and garlands of fragrant

To-morrow I will bring thee
A kid, whose forehead‚

Swollen with budding horns, doth love and battle fore-
Vainl}l‚lal-as1—the youngling, pride of the wauton flook,
With orimson must ensanguine
Thy clear oold rippleS.

The fiery midsummer noon never ean pieroe thy shade,
Grateful ooolness thou hast to glad the wandering kine‚
And the slow-stepping oxen
With ploughshare wearied.

Among the fountains of fame I will make loom for thee,
Singing thine ilex· trees that spread their sheltering boughs

Over thy rooky hollows
And babbling mnnels,
