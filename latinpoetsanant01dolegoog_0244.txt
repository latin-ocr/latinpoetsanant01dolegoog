THE SHIP OF STATE.
ODE XIV„ Boon Ι.

On Ship! new billows sweep thee out

Seaward. What wilt thou ἰ) Hold the port, be stout.
See'st not thy mast

How rent by stiff Southwestern blast ⁴?

' Thy side, of rewers how forlorn ⁶?
Thine hull, with groaning yards‚ with rigging torn,
⁶ Can ill sustain
The fleme, and ever fiercer main3

Thy gods, no more than sails entire,

From whom yet once thy need might aid require,
Oh Pontio Fine,

The first of woodland stoeks is thine,

Yet raee and name are but as dust. η

Not, painted sterne give storm-tosb seamen trust3
Unless thou dare

Το be the spol-t of stormS, beware.

Of old at best a weary weight,

A yearning care and constant strain of late,
O shun the seas

That gird those glittering Cyclades„

THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS.
Ona XV„ Boon Ι.

As the treacherous shepherd bore over the deep
His hosteSS, fair Helena, Nereus arose,

Husht the war of the winds for a season to sleep,
And thus sang the doom of retributive woes:

“ Thou bear-esf, her home'with an omen of dread,
Whom Greece shall reelaiqm, with her myriads vowed
To tear, by the sword, thy false mate from thy bed, ·
And erush Priam's empire, the ancient, the proud.
