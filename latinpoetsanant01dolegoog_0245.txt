“Horse'and man, how they labour! What deaths shall
Andzfirssolsseffl} 0111116, the Dardanians in night!

See Pallas preparing 1161· 36313 and helm,
Her ohariot, and all the 116106 frenzy of fight!

⁴ “ Go, trim as thou wilt, boy‚ thy loose flowing 011113,
Go, vaunt thee, that Venus shall shield thee from
And, 1311011ῗέ1] thy late ’midst a bevy of girls,

Troll thy measures effeminate all the day long.

“ Ay, hide an thou may'st in the 0011011 of thy lust

From the death-dealing spear, and the arrows of Crete,
From the 1031 of the battle, its carnage, its dust,

And Ajax pursuing, remorseless and fleet!

“ Yet in 3016 thy adulterous looks shall be rolled‚
Though late be thy doom. Lo, the soom-ge of thy 1306,
Laertiades 1 1)031 111011 not see him! Behold!

And Pylian Nestor! -And 366, 011 thy 11306

“ Rushes Teucer of SalamiS, dauntless and fell,
And StheneluS, skilful in 001111131, nor less

In ruling the war-steed expert to excel, ι

“ Lo, Tydides, 3111ρ3331113 1113 father in might,
Athirst for thy lifeblood, with furious oheer.
Is hunting thee 0111 through the thick of the fight,

While before him 111011 fiy'st, like a 11111010113 deer,

κ Who, espying a wolf on the brow of the hin, ’
Flies far from the pasture, with heart-heaving pants;
Is it 111113 11131 thy leman shall see 11166 fulfil

The promise of all thy presumptuous vaunts ⁶?

“ The wrath of Achilles shall stay for a while
The downfall of Ilion, and Phrygia's dames, -
Yet a few winters more, and her funeral pile
In ashes shall fall 'midst Achaian flames 1 ”
