THE REGANTATION.

. Onu XVI., Boon Ι.

Lovnmr mother’s lovelier daughter,
Those sharp verses, edged with blame,
Hurl into the Adrian water,
Cancel, if thou wilt, with flame,
Rhea from her mountain-hollow,
Liber at his royal feastS,
From his Delphian shrine Apelle,
Shake the spirit of their priests.
Hark, the votaries loud and often
Shrilly clanging cymbals ring—
These are savage, but may soften —
Anger is a sterner thing.
Not the ship-destroying ocean,
Norio steel, or flammg fire,
Not the storm-god's mighty motion
Fright it from its purpose dire.
When Prometheus first transmuted
Atoms culled for human clay,
Deep the lion's rage he rooted
In our breast, as legends say.
Anger with a grievous ruin
Smote Thyestes and his line;
This, the fount of sheer undeing,
Left of cities scal-oe a sign,
When among the sworded nations‚
Armies flusht with pride and spoil
Ploughed up many a State's foundations
Planted in imperial soil.
Curb thy soul with juster measures -
Me youth's sweetneSS‚ prone to wrong,
Heated into quiek displeasureS,
And an ill-directed song.

’ Now my bitterness would mellow,
I annul the trenohant strain3
Be once more my true love-fellow3
Take me to thy heart again.
