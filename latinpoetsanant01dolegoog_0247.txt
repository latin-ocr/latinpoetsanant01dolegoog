OF'r Faunus leaves Arcadia's plain,
And 18 1118 Sabine hill retreats:
He guards my floeks from rushing rain,
From piercing windS, and soorching 118818,
Where lurks the thyme, or shrubs appear,
My wanton kids securely play3
My 88818 118 poisonous serpent fear,
· Safe wandering through 1118 woodland way.
No hostile wolf 1118 sold invades;
Ustica's pendant rocks, rebound
My song3 and all the sylvan shadeS,
By echo taught, return 1118 sound.
The gods my verse propit-,ious hear,
My head from every danger shield:
For you o'erflows the bounteous year,
And plenty's horn hath heaped my field.
Responsive 18 1118 Τ81811 8111118
Within 1118 San-defended vale,
Here, softly warbling, you shall sing
anh 18111181, tuneful, amorous 1818.
No rival here shall 1111181 1118 hands
That wreathe my charmer’s beauteous hair,
Nor seize her weakly struggling hands;
But love and Horace guard 1118 fair.

Yon 8111111 1118, Chloe, wild and shy,
As some stray fawn 11181 888118 118 mother
Through 1188111888 woods. If spring winds 81811
11 vainly strives its fears to 8111811181.

Its trembling 1111888 888811 88811 811181

When lizards 8111 1118 brambles dry ; —
You shun me, (311188, wild and shy,

As some stray fawn 11181 888118 118 111811181.
