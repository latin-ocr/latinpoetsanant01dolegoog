224 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

And yet no Libyan lion Ι, -

No ravening thing to rend another 3
Lay by your tears‚ your tremor-s dry,
A husband’s better than a brother3
Nor shun me, Chloe, wild and shy,
As some stray fawn that seeks its mother.

A PRAYER. ’
01>ss XXXI„ Boon Ι.

WHA'r asks the poet, who adores
Apollo's virgin shrine,

What asks 116, as he freely pours
The consecr-ating wine ⁶?

Not the rich' grain, that waves along
Sardinia's fertile land,

Nor the unnumbered herde, that throng
Calabria's sultry strand3

Not gold, nor ivory's snowy gleam‚
The spoil of far Cathay,

Nor fields, which Liris, quiet stream,
Gnaws silently away.

Let fortune’ s favoured sons the vine
Of fair Campania hold3

The merchant quaff the rarest wine
From eups of gleaming gold3

For to the gods the man is dear
Who soathlessly can brave,

Three times or more in every year,
The wild Atlantia wave.

Let oliveS, endive‚ mallows light
Be all my fare3 and health

Give 1311011, 1131306, so Ι might
Enjoy my present wealth!
