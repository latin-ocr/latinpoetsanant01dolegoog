To ALBIUS TIBULLUS. 225

Give me but these, I ask no more,
These, and a mind entire —

And old age, not unhonoured, nor
Unsolaced by the ly‘re!

— Translation os Sm Tnnononn: MAnrm.

ΤΟ ALBIUS TIBULLUS.
Ona: XXXIII„ Boon Ι.

Nur, Albius, a truce to this sighing and grieving!
Is Glycera worth all this tempest of woe ⁶?

Why flatter her, lachrymose elegies weaving,
Because she is false for a youthfuller beau ⁴?

There 's LycoriS, the maid with the small rounded
Fofioffilrlrehasflis wasting by inches away3

Whilst for Pholoe he, with a passion as torrid,
Consumes‚ and to him she 'll have nothing to say.

The she-goatS, in fact, might be sooner expected
Apulia's wolves for their partners to take,
Than 3 girl so divine to be ever connected
With such an abandoned and pitiful rake.

Such caprices hath Venus, wh0‚ rarely propitiouS,
Delights in her setters of iron to bind

Those pairs whom she sees, with 3 pleasure 111311010118,
Unmatched both in fortune, and figure, and mind.

Ι, myself, wooed by one that was truly a jewel,

In thraldom was held, which I cheerfully bore,
, By that common chit, Myrtale, though she was cruel
As waves that indent the Calabrian shore.
