226 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

ΤΟ HIMSELF.

Onn XXXIV„ Boon 1.

Amo a herd of learned fools,
I traoed old Epicurus' ruleS,
Through all 1119 mazes of 1119 30110013,
And seldom deigned 10 pray:
But now no more-his schemes prevail,
I veer 10 catch a different gale,
And 10 religion's harbour sail,
As reason points 1119 way.

Arrayed in all 1119 pomp of war,
The god ascendshis burning oar,
⁸ Quiver 1119 lightnings from afar,
And 1119 big clouds divide.
Involved in horrid gloom he flies
ImpetuouS, down 1119 passive skieS,

While, round his throne, lond tempests riso,
And fires before him glide.

Heaven shrinks beneath his rolling wheels‚
His thunder shakes 1119 eterna] hills,
And 1119 vast flood her bed reveaIS,
To shun 1119 approaohing god.
E'en 1119 deep vaults of hell below,
Where streams of endless torments flow,
Tremble, while horrid lightnings glow
Through all 1119 dark abode.

Almighty God! Eternal King 1

Who ean thy matehless glories sing ?

From thee, 1119 fates of nations spring,
And tyrants own thy sway3

Whose power can pull the mighty down,

Exalt the peasant 10 9 throne,

And place 1119 deeds of hands unknown,
Amid 1119 blaze of day.
