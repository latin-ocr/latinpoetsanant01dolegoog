228 QUINTUS HORA TIUS FLACCUS.

What slaughters and murder our bodies disdain 3
See brother, by brother, inhumanly slain!

What altar, or shrine, has escaped from the rage
Of faction and orimeS, in this eurst iron age ?

Then brighten, Ο goddess! our weapons once more,
Besmeared with rank murder and citizen's gore,

Let our swords be unsheathed 'gainst the foes of the state,
The vagabond Arab, and treacherous Gebe.

-- Valley Forye paraphrase (1778).

 

ΤΟ CRISPUS SALLUSTIUS CRISPUS.
ουκ 11.‚ Boox' 11

YEs, you deservedly despise
The wealth that use ne' er taught to shine‚
That rusting in the ooffer lies
Like ore yet buried 111 the mine· ‚
For gold, my friend, no lustre knows
But what, a wise well-tempered use bestOWS.

Thee, Proculeius! distant days
Will bleSS, and make thy virtues known,
Conspiring tongues will sound thy praise‚
’ Α father' s love to brethren shown:- -
Transcendent worth, like thine, will. fly. ·
, On Fame' s unflagging pinions t'hrough the sky.

A monarch far more potent he
Who subject keeps his wayward sou13
Who lives from sordid avarioe free,
And dares each fieroer lust control,
Than he whose universal sway
Wide earth's extremeS‚ her East and West obey.

‘ That sensual sels-indulgent wretoh
Whose skin the panting dropsy strainS,
Stin must the watery languor streteh,
And only Temperanoe ease his veins;
So growing wealth promptas new desire,

And. Fortune's breeze but fans the wasting fire.
