TO QUINTUS DELLIUS. 229

The Persian hails the public voice
Decked with the crown that Cyrus wore3
But virtue sanctioris not the choice ;
She calls PhraateS‚ blest, no more ε
Can tyrant hands, defiled with sin,
The fair, the spotless mind of virtue win ⁴?

Virtue, their rule perverse, shall own
Which bliss to wealth and grandeur leaves,
From virtue he and he alone,
The wreath and diadem receives
Who dares theglittering heap pass by
With steadfast mien and unreverted eye.

— Translation os Ginnsu‘r Wumrmu).

 

ΤΟ QUINTUS DELLIUS.

One ΙΙΙ., Boon 11.

Wmm dangers press, a mind sustain
Unshaken by the stoi-ms of Fate3

And when delight succeeds to pain,
With no glad insolence elate3

For death will end the various toys

Of hopes, and fears‚ and cares, and joys.

Morta] alike, if sadly grave
You pass life's melancholy day,

Or, in some green retired cave
Wearing the idle hours away,

Give to the Muses all your soul,

And pledge them in the flowing bowl:

Where the broad pine, and poplar white,
To join their hospitable shade
With intertwisted boughs delight3
And, o'er its pebbly bed conveyed‚
Labours the winding stream to run,
Trembling‚ and glittering to the sun.
