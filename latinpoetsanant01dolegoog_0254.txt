230 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

Th generous wine, and rich perfume,
nd fragrant roses hither bring,
That with the early zephyrs bloom,
And wither with declining spring,
While joy and outh not yet have fled,
And Fate still olds the uncertain thread.

You soon must leave our verdant bowers
And groves, yourse f had taught to grow3

Your soft retreats from sultry hours,
Where Tiber's gentle waters flow,

Soon leave3 and all you call our own

Be squandered by an heir nown.

Whether of wealth and lineage proud,
A high patrician name you bear,

Or pass ignoble in the crowd
Unsheltered from the midnight air,

’Τ is all alike3 no age or state

Is spared by unrelenting Fate.

To the same port our barks are bound;
“ One final doom is fixt for all:

The universal wheel goes round,
And, soon or late, each lot must fall,

When all together shall be sent
To one eternal banishment.

Conquered Achilles;

So, too, the captive form of fair Tecmessa

Conquered her captor Telamonian Ajax3

And a wronged maiden, in the midst of triumph,
Fired Agamemnon,
