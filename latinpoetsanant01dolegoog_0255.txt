THE MEA N. 231

What time had fallen the barbarian forces

Before the might of the Thessalian vietor,

And Heetor’s loss made easy to worn Hellas·
Troy's mighty ruin.

How dost iabou know but what thy fair-haired Phyllis
May make thee son-in-law to splendid parents ’.Ρ
Doubbless she mourns the wrong to raee and hearth-gods

Injured, but regal.

Believe not thy beloved of birth plebeiam
A girl so faithful, so averse from luere,

Could not be born of an ignoble mother
Whom thou wouldst blush for.

That lovely face, those arms, those tapering ankles—
N ay, in my praises never doubt my honour:
The virtuous man who rounds the age of forty

Hold unsuspeeted.

— Translation os Loun er‘ron.

Tms is the better life, dear friend,

Not always in mid sea to wend,

Nor yet distrustfully portend
Storms honrly near,

And hug, not wisely in the end,
Ill shores in fear. ·

That man, who in his soul hath seen

How lovely is the golden mean,

He laeks the wretchedness unelean
Of used-up walls3

He laelm, in soberness serene,
Wealth’s envied halls.
