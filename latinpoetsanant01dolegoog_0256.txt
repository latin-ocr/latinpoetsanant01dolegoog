232 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLA C'C'U'S.

Pines of a stature proud and vast
Shake oftener when the winds rusb past,
Down to the earth high towers are cast
With heavier fall,
And still the fiery lightnings blast
The hill-‘eope tall.

The breast, that wisdom's rule obeyS,

Hopes for a change in evil days»,

And fears it amid prosperous ways
Remote from ill ;

Since God. both causes and allays
Our storms at will.

If fortune fail thee now, yet know
It will not: evermore be so;
Apollo may his lube foregO,
But not fol-ever,
Nor bears he always a strung bow
And armed quiver.

Thou, when adversities ensue,

Prove thyself constant, brave and true,

And when the risks seem far and few,
Mid favouring gales

Furl in good honr, with cantion due,
Thy swelling sails.

ΤΟ POSTUMUS.

One XIV., Boon 11.

. How swiftly glide our flying years!
Alae! nor piety, nor tears
Can stop the fieeting day3
Deep-furrowed wrinkles‚ posting age,
And death's unconquerable rage,
Are strangers to delay.
