To POSTUMUS.

Though every day a bull should bleed
To Pluto, bootless were the deed,

The monaroh tearless reigns‚
VVhere vulture-tortured Tityus lies,
And triple Geryon's monstrous size

The gloomy wave detainS.

Whoever tastes of earthly food
Is doomed to pass the joyless flood,
And hear the Stygian roar3

The seeptred king, who rules the earth.

The labouring hind, of humbler birth,
Must reaoh the distant shore.

The broken surge of Adria's main,

Hoarse-sounding, we avoid in vain,
And Mars in blood-stained arms;

The southern blasi: in vain we sear,

And autumn’s life-annoying air ,
With idle fears alarms;

For all must see Cocytus fiow,
Whose gloomy water sadly slow
Strays through the dreary soil.
The guilty maidS‚ an ill-famed train!
And, Sisyphus, thy labours vain,
Condemned to endless toil.

Your pleasing consort must be left,
And you of villam, landS, bet-eft,

Must to the shades deseend3 ’
The oypress only, hated tree!

Of all thy much-loved groves, shall thee,

Its short-lived lord‚ attend.

Then shall your worthier heir discharge,

And set ‘ch’ imprisoned oasks at large,
And dye the floor with. wine,

So rich and preciouS‚ not the feasts

Of holy pontiffs oheer their guests
With liquor more divine.
