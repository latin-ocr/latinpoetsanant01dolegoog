The towering pile, and soft abodes,

Walled by the hand of servile godS,

Now spreads 113 1111113 311 around,

And lies inglorious on the ground.

An umpire partial and unjust,

And a lewd woman' 3 impious lust

Lay heavy on her head, and sank her to the dust.

Since false Laomedon’ 3 tyrannic sway

That durst defraud the immortals of their pay,

Her guardian gods renounced their patronage,
Nor would the fierce invading foe repel ;

To my resentment, and Minerva's rage,

The guilty king and 13116 whole people fell.
And now the long-protracted wars are o'er,
The soft adulterer shines no 111016;

No more does Hector' 3 force the Trojans shield,

Thatfidffve whole armies back, and singly cleared the

My vengeance sated, I at length resign

To Μ313 1113 offspring of the TrOJ'an line: ·

Advanced 10 godhead, let him rise,

And take his station in the skies:

There entertain his ravisht sight

With scenes of glory, fields of light:

Quaff with the gods immortal wine,

And 366 adoring nations crowd 1113 shrine.

The thin remains of Troy' 3 afflicted 110313
In distant realms may seats unenvied find,

And flourish on a foreign coast3
But far be Rome from Troy disjoined,
Removed by 3633 from the disastrous shore,-
May endless billows 1136 between, and storms unnumbered

1031.
Still let the curst detested place
Where Priam lies, and Priam's faithless race,
Be covered o'er with weeds, and hid in grass.
There let the wanton flocks unguarded stray3

Or, while the lonely shepherd singS,
Amidst the mighty ruins play,

And frisk upon the tombs of kings.

May tigers there, and all the savage kind
Sad solitary haunts and deserts find3
In gloomy vaults and nooks of palaceS,
