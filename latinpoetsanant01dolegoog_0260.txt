236 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

May the unmolested lioness
Her brindled whelps securely lay,
Or, couched‚ in dreadful slumbers waste the day.
While Troy in heaps of ruins lies,
Rome and the Roman Capitol shall rise3
The illustrious exiles unconfined
Shall triumph far and near, and rule mankind.
In vain the sea's intruding tide
Europe from Afric shall divide,
And part the severed world m two:

Through Afric’ s sands their triumphs they shall spread,
And the long train of victor-ies pursue

To Nile' 3 yet undiscovered head.
Riches the hardy soldiers shall (19311139,
And look on gold with undesiring eyeS‚
Nor the disbowelled earth explore
In search of the forbidden or;e
Those 8111191 11183 ills, concealed within the mine
Shall lie uutoucht, aud innocently shine.
To the last bounds that nature sets
The piercing colds and sultry 119313,
The godlike 1309 shall spread their arms ;
Now fill the polar circle with alarmS‚
Till storms and tempests their pursuits confine; ⁶
Now sweat for conquest underneath the 11119.
Τ1113 only law the victor shall restrain3
On these conditions 311311 119 reign.
If none his guilty hand employ
To build again a second Troy,
lf none 1119 13311 design pursue‚
Nor tempt 1119 vengeance of the gods anew.
A curse there cleaves 10 1119 devoted place,
That shall the new foundations raze ;
Greece shall in mutual leagues conspire
To storm the rising town with 1119,
And at their armies' head myself will show
What J 0110, urged to all her rago, 0311 do.
Thrice should Apollo's self the city 13139,
And line it round with walls of brass;
Thrice should my favourite Greeks his works confound‚
And hew the shining fabric to the ground:
Thrice should her captive dames to Greece return,
And their dead sons and slaughtered husbands mourn.'’
