LOVE RENE WED. 237

But hold, my muse, fol-bear thy towering ssight,
Nor bring the secrete of the gods to light:

In vain would thy presumptuous verse

The immortal rhetorio rehearse3

The mighty strains, 111 lyrio numbers bound,
Forget their majesty, and lose the sound.

— Translatz'on os Jomv Anmsox.

 

LOVE RENEWED.
Onu: IX„ Boox III.

Horace. While to thee no other name was nearer,
Ere a rival youth aspired to fling

Round thy snow-white n'eok embraees dearer,
I lived richer than a king.

Lydia. Ere a new flame to thy false heart beekoned,
When the elder passion seemed divine,

Nor was Lydia yet to Chloe second,
Roman Ilia's glory paled to mine.

Horace. Now Inte-learned, skilled in measures tendet,
Thracian Chloe doth my heart enslave,

Life for herI dread not-to surrender, .. f ·
If the Fates my other soul will save.

Lydia. Child of Thurian Ornytus I eherish3
Mutual flames to me doth Calais bear.
Twice for him will I consent, to perish,
If the Fates my dai-ling boy will spare.

Horace. What if yet the ancient love returning,
Reunite in brazen yoke us twain,

If this door, the gold-haired Chloe spnrning,
Weloome cast-off Lydia onoe again ?

Lydia. He is fairer than a star in heaven,
Thou more fieroe than Adria's restive sea,
Light as eork— yet, oh, 311133 3110133 13 given,
Lei: me live and love and die with thee!
