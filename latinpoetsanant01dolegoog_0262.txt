238 QUINTUS HoRA TIUS FLA c'ws,

TO NEOBULE.

Onu XII., Boon: 111.

UNHAPPY the maidens forbidden to prove

The bumper's full joy, or the raptures of love3

Unhappy the girls, who are destined to hear

The bedious rebukes of old unoles severe.
Cytheraea’s winged son now bids thee resign

The toils of Minerva, the spinster divine3

For now, Neobule‚ w'ith other desires

The brightness of Hebrus thy bosom 1nspi1es3

When he rises with vigour fiom Tiber' s rough' waveS‚

Where the oil of his labours athletic 116 laveS,

Like Bellerophon skilful to rein the fierce 316611,

At cuffs never conquered, nor outstripped 1n speed‚

And dextrous with darts never flying 111 vain,

To wound the light stag, bounding over t-he plain,

Or active and valiant the boar to surprise,

Transfixt with his spear‚ as in eovert he lies.

— Translation os Pmmr Pinnem.

 

TO THE FOUNTAIN BANDUSIA.
01111 ΧΗΙ., Boon ΠΙ.

Ο FONT! with fair unruffled face,

More clear than crystal and more bright than glass3
To thee my only bowl shall pour

The sweet libation crowned with many a flower.
To thee a sportive kid shall bleed‚

Proud of the spreading honours of his head3

’ Who meditates the angry shoek,

For some first love the fairest of the flook.
In vain-l for Venus will nob save —

His youthful blood shall tinge thy azure wave.
Not Phoebus, with his summer 11661113,

Can penetrate thy shade‚ and gild thy streams5
But ever from the dog-sbar's heal:

The wearied hei-ds require thy green retreat.
