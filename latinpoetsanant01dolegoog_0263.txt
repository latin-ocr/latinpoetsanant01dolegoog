To MAECENA s. 239

Lei: other bards their fountains sing,
A bard shall love and celebrate thy spring,
The secret shelter of thy wood‚
And bubbling rills that fall into thy flood,

TO MAECENAS.
Ona XVI„ Boox 111.

Low} in her tower had languished Danae,
Fast caged by massive heavy-bolted doom,
And guarded safe by savage-baying hounds
From midnight lovers' vows:

But Jupiter and Venus laughed to scorn
The anxious jailer of the hidden maid,
Acrisius, — for the quest would easy prove
To gold-disguised god.

Through armed guards gold loves to thread its way,
And stronger than the thunder-bolt, break through

Α Thiok walls of rook. The Argive augur's house
For love of lucre fell,

In ruin plunged3 the man of, Macedon
Gleft city-gates and undermined the power

,Of rival thrones with bribes: and. bribes will buy
The navy's doughty lords.

Care follows growing ‘wealth‚ and in its tracks
Comes thirsi: for greater things3 hence have I shrunk

From lifting high my head above the throng,
Maeoenas, flower of knights.

The more sshat man shall manfully foreg0,
The more the gods shall give. Naked I seek
The camp of the contented, and with joy
Deseris the ranks of wealth.
