240 QUINTUS HORA TIUS FLACCUS.

More glorious as the lord of things despised
Than if within my granaries lay the erops

For which the Apulian toils with plough and seythe, »
Mid wide possessione, poor.

A limpid stream, a narrow strip of wood8‚
And my unshaken hope of ripening grain,
To him who shines with sunny Afrie's orown
Seem not a fairer lot.

Though not for me Calabrian bees hive sweetS,
Nor wine grows mellow in its Formian jars,
Nor floeks for me graze in the Gallio meadS,
With ever-thiekening fleeoe‚

From poverty’s insistenee am I free, —

Nor, did Ι long for more, wouldst thou deny.
Better ean Ι by limited desires

Extend my scanty meane,

Thau if Ι added to Alyattes’ realm

The Phrygian fields‚ who yearns for much laoks much,
Blessed is he to whom, with sparing hand,
God giveth just enough.

AGAINST AV⁹ARICE AND LUXURY.
Omr. XVIII„ Boox ΙΙΙ.

No walls with ivory inlaid

Adorn my house3 no oolonnade

Proudly supports my citt-on beamS‚

Nor rich with gold my oeiling flames;
’ Nor have Ι, like an heir unknown,

Seized upon Attalus's throne 3

Nor dameS, to happier fortunes bred,

Draw down for me the purple thread3

Yet, with a firm and honest heart,

Unknowing or of fraud or art,
