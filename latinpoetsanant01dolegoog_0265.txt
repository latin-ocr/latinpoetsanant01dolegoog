. AGAINST AVARICE ΛΝΒ LUXURY. 241

With liberal vein of genius blessed,

I 'm by the rich and great caressed.
My patron's gift, my Sabine field,
Shall all its rural plenty yield3
And happy in that rural store, ,

. of Heaven and him I ask no more.

Day presses on the heels of day,

And moons increase to their decay ;
But you, with thoughtless pride elate,
Unconscious of impending fate,
Command the pillared dome to rise,
When, lo! thy tomb forgotten lies;
And, though the waves indignant roar,
Forward you urge the Baian shore3
While earth's too narrow bounds in vain
Your guilty progress would restrain,

The sacred landmark strives in vain

Your impious avarice to resti-ain:

. - You break into your neighbour's grounds,
And overleap your client's boundS.

Driven out by thee, to new abodes

They carry their paternal gods;

The wife her husband's sorrow shareS‚
And on her breast her squalid infant bears.

Yet destined by unerring fate,

Shall death this wealthy lord await:
Then whither tend thy wide domains?
For Earth impartial entertains

Her various sonS, and in her breast
Princes and beggars equal rest.

Nor gold could bribe, nor art deceive
The gloomy life-guard of the grave,
Backward to tread the shadow‘y way,
And wast Prometheus into day.

Yet he, who Tantalus detainS,

With all his haughty race in chainS,
Invoked or not, the wretch receive8‚
And from the toils of life relieveS.
