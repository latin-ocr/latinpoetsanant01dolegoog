242 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

ΤΟ DIAN A.
One XXII., Book ΙΙΙ.

CHAs'rE goddess Of the radiant night

Who lov'st the airy mountain's height
And guard'st the sylvan bower3

Who thrioe invoked with pious prayers

Reliev'st the teeming 1nat1·on’s cares
Saved by thy triple power:

Accept this vow 1 henoeforth the pine

That shades my humble roos is thine;
Where, menaoing the sight

Slain by my hand a boar shall stain

anh year, thy consecrated fane,

' On this returnin g light.

'— Trcmslation of WILLIAM Boscawnu.

 

ΤΟ MELPOMENE.
Onu-XXX„ Boon III.

Mons durable than braSS‚ in height
Surpassing far the regal site
Of pyramidS, l've raised a tower
That shall defy the oankering shower,
Nor northern blast‚ nor lapse of time
Shall mar the beauties of its prime.
1 shall not wholly die, for still shall live
My better part for aye, to give
Freshness and vigour to the praise
. That Ι shall reap in after dayS.
Long as the priest the Capitol asceticis,
And her chaste steps the silent vestal bends:
Famous‚ though sprung of lowly birth,
O'er thirsty Daunus' sterile earth; ‚
XVhere Aufidus’ hoarse waves resound‚
¹ There shall my name with fame be erowned
As the first poet who had sung
AEolian verse in Latin tongue.
Melpomene! usurp thy sway‚
My temples wreathe with Delphio bay.
— Translacion os His-,numu- Garun.
