Tun snows are past away, the field renews
Its grassy robe, the trees with leaves are crowned3
All nature 16613 6 change3 the streams unloose
Their bands 01 166, and bathe the meads aroundg
The sister Graues with the Nymphs advanee
In light attire, weaving the joyous danoe.

Warned by the varying year and hastening day,
Expect not 1311011, my friend, immortal joys :

Spring's zephyr melts the winter’s frost away,
And spring the summer's hotter breath destroyS‚

Soon forced to wait on autumn’s mellow train,

Till oold and sluggish winter 111163 again.

The seasons' differenoe rolling moons repair3 ’
But we, 11 01106 to that sad shore eonveyed

Where the great manes of our fathers are,
Shall be but empty ashes and a shade.

Who knows 11 they that rule this mortal 0111116

Will add to-morrow to our sum 01 time?

Thy generous 30111 0611 116313 improve the 1101113
Of the short 1116 allowed by partia] Heaven3

Yet thee, TorquatUS, in those gloomy bowers
Where Minos' last tremendous (loom 13 given,

Not all thy pride of honour-able birth,

Nor wit, nor virtue, 0611 16313016 130 earth 1

’ Not e’en the huntress 01 13116 silvei· bow.
Who made the chaste Hippolytus her care,
Could bring his spirit 110111 the realms below:
Nor Theseus armed with force immortal tear
His loved Perithous from the triple 6116111
That bound his 30111 to that infernal plain.
