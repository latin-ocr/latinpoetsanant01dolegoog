QUINTUS HORA TIUS FLA CC'US.

ΤΟ CENSORINUS.

Ome VIII„ Boox IV.

Wrrn ‚liberal heart 1ο every friend

A bowl or caldron would I send3

Or tripods, which the Grecians gave,
As rich rewardS, 1ο heroes brave3
Nor should the meanest gift be thine,

, If the rich works of arb were mine,

By ScopaS, or Parrhasius wrought,
With animating skill who taught

The shapeless stone with life to glow,
Or bade the breathing colours flow,
To imitate, in every line,

The form or human or divine.

, Β111 I nor boast the curious store,
And you nor want, nor wish for more3
'T is yours the joys of verse 1ο know,
Such joys as Horace can bestow,
While I can vouch my present's worth,
And call its every virtue forth

Nor columns, which the public raise,
Engraved with monumental praise,
By which 1116 1113311ῂ of life returns
To heroes, sleeping in their urus :
Nor Hannibal, when swift he fied,
His threats retorted on his head ;
Nor impious Carthage wrapt in flame,
From whence great Scipio gained 3 name,
Such glories round him could diffuse
As the Calabrian poet's muse-3
And should the bard his aid deny,
Thy worth shall unrewarded die.
Had envious silence lest unsung
The child from Mars 31111 Ilia sprung,

’ How had we known the hero's fame,

From whom the Roman empire came ⁴?
The poet's favour, voice and layS,
Could AEacus from darkness raise,
Snatcht from the Stygian gulfs of hell,
Among theblissful isles 1ο dwell.
