To MARCUS LOLLIUS. 245

The Muse forbids the brave to die,
The Muse enthrones him in the sky;
Alcides, thus, in heaven is placed,
And shares with Jove the immortal feast3
Thus the twin-stars have power to save
The shattered vessel from the wave‚
And vine-orowned Bacchus with success
His jovial votaries can bless.

— Translation os Pmmr anom.

 

TO MARCUS LOLLIUS.
Onu: IX„ Boon IV.

,1¹an not those strains ean e'er expire,

Which, cradled mid the eohoing roar
of AufiduS‚ to Latium's lyre ⁶

I sing with arts unknown before.
Though Homer fill the foi-emost throne,

Yet grave Stesichorus still can please‚
And fieroe Aloaeus holds his own

With Pindar and Simonides„
The songs of Teos are not mute,

And Sappho's love is breathing still:
She told her secret to the Inte,

And yet its ohords with passion thrill.
Not Sparta's queen alone was fired

By broidered robe and braided tre88‚
And all the splendours that attired

Her lover’s guilty loveliness :
Not only Teucer to the field

His arrows brought, nor Ilion
Beneath a single conqueror reeled:

Not Crete's majestio lord alone,
Or Sthenelus, earned the Muses' orown:

Not Hector first for child and wife,
Or brave DeiphobuS‚ laid down

The burden of a manly life.
Before Atrides men were brave:

But ah ! oblivion, dark and long,
Has lookt them in a tearless grave,

For laok of consecrating song.
