246 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

'Twixt worth and baseneSS, lapt in death, .
What difference ? You shall ne'er be dumb,
While strains of mine have voice and breath:
The dull neglect of days to come
Those hard-ivon honours shall not blight:
Nc, Lollius, 'noz a soul is yourS,
Clear-sighted, keen, alike upright
When fortune smileS‚ and when she lowers:
Το greed and rapine still severe,
Spurning the gain men find so sweet: ·
A consul, not of one brief year,
But oft as on the judgment-seat
You bend the expedient to the right,
Turn haughty eyes from bribes away,
Or bear your banners through the sight,
Scattering the foeman’s firm array.
The lord of boundless revenueS,
Salute not him as happy: nc,
Call him the happy, who can use
The bounty that the gods bestow‚
' Can bear the load of poverty,
¹ And tremble not at death, but sin:
No recreant he when called to die
In cause of country or of kin.

PHOEBUs, and thou, Diana, sylvan Power!

Blest pair —revered, and still to be revel-ed —

Bright gems of ether! grant the suit preferred
At this fixed hour

Of hallowed joy, when (as the Sibyl's lays

 

Ordained) chaste Youths and Virgins to the Powers -

Τ1131 guard the city and her seven-hilled towers
Pour songs of praise!
