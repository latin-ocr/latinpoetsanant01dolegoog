THE SECULAR ODE. 247

Τ11011 genia] Suu! whose orb in heaven’s high dome

Reveals and shrouds the day— still rising new

And still the same — may nothing meet thy view,
Greater than Rome!

And thou, Lucina! lenient to disclose
The ripened birth— whatever name best please
Thine ear — Natalis 1 Ilithyia! — ease

Our matron's throes!

Grant large increase, and speed the Senate's cause,

Who strengthen (studious 01 111611 country's good)

Pure wedlock's bandS, and’to recruit her brood
Stamp nuptial laws:

That oft as years, to decades full eleven
Revolving, shall renew with solemn rite

This Jubilee, glad anthems day and night
May rise to heaven.

And yon, whose verdict, once declared‚ stands fast,
Linked in Necessity's 61611161 6116111,
Ye Destinies! with future blessings deign

To crown the past 1

May Barth, boon parent, rich in flocks and fruit,
Grace Ceres with a wreath 01 golden ears

While 1116 8011 shower and gale salubrioris rears
· Each budding shoot!

Placid and mild, thy shafts of vengeance sheathed,

Hear thou the Youths‚ majestic Lord of light!

Hear thou ’1116 prayer, bicorned Queen 01 night,
By Virgins breathed!

Blest twain 1 if Rome from you derived her 10111115-

Ι1 11111161, led by yon, the Trojan hands

Urged a 8616 6011186, what 111116 for distant lands
They changed 111611 hearth3

To whom, unscathed, through Ilium wrapt in flame,
The brave survivor 01 1116 1611(1 he lost
Oped 6 1166 path, to found on Latium's coast

A nobler name3
