248 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

Grant to our docile youth eaoh virtuous grace !
To weary veterane grant serene repose'!

Grani: health, wealth, issue, all that Heaven bestows
To Rome’s whole raoe!

And ma the Prinoe, who at your shrine bids flow
The miffl-white heifer's blood, Anchises' heir,
Long rule, 130 0111811 the rebel and 130 spare

The prostrate foe!

The Mede, now quelled by land as 011 the wave,

Has 130 0111 arms and Alban Axes bowed;

The Scythian hol-dee, and Indian (late 80 proud)
Our meroy orave.

Truth, Honour, generous Shame (repelled with soom),
¹ Mild Peaoe, and Virtue that 130 heaven had flown,
¹ Dare 130 101311111, and Plenty hastes 130 orown
1 · Her brimming Horn.

Be sure, 13110 golden-quivered God, who sees

Fate's awful mysterieS, whom 13110 warbling N ine

Hail as their leader, and whose arts benign
Assuage disease,

Will, if he smile on his own sacred 13οΨ018,

Prolong 13110 Roman weal and Latium's bliss

From age 130 age, and still improve from 131118
To happier hours:

Nor less will She, 80 long on Aventine

And Algidus enshrined, her votaries now

Propitious heed, and 130 0111 youthful vow
Kind ears incline. -

We, then, 13110 band who jointly 1311110 their praise,

Bear home a sure and oheering hope, that Jove

Lists and appi-oves, with all the Ηο813 above,
These ohoral layS.
