TOWN LIFE AND COUNTRY LIFE.

TOWN LIFE- AND COUNTRY LIFE.

‘⁶ Tun SATIRES. ’²

Ι Imm a wish for one small lot

Of meadow land, a garden plot,

Beside a olump of wood, and near

My door a rivulet running 01001.

Τ1118 811111 of all imagined bliss

The Gods have given, and more than 11118.
Ε11011311; if, Hermes! thou 001181311

Τ110 boon, for life to 0011 1110111 mine!

If ne’er I sought to make my store
Though soant, by means dishonest, more '3
Nor shrank the little Ι possess

By 00101088 thrift or loose excess:

If ne'er to heaven I bend my knees

With fond petitionS, suoh as these:—

“ Oh, that the owner would but yield
That nook which so misshapes my field! ”
‘³ Oh, that my olinking plough had found
A pot of silver under ground3

Like him, who with the treasure bought
The field in whioh for hire he wrought3
At one kind hit, to wealth and ease
Lifted, by help of Hercules.”

If pleased and grateful for my 1013,

Τ1118, Meroury, deny me not:

May cattle thrive 011 my (1011101118,

And all be fat— except my brains 1

Α1111 811Π, 08 usual, deign 130 guard

Your most devoted slave and 110111.
When out of town I haste to dwell

Snug in my mountain eitade13

What better pastime 0011 Ι 0110080

Τ11011 801110 01111 the prose-like Muse ’.Ρ
No visits pester me to death3

No flagging winds weigh down my breath3
No sickly Autumn 031108 give,

Whenoe orabbed undertakers live.
Father of Morn! or J 011118, hear 1
Whiohever name may catch thine ear3

Since 't is the will of God, that all
