250 QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS.

On thy protection duly call,

Who take in hand some weighty matter,

From thee will Ι begin my satire.

Bail for a friend you bid me fly

11¹0 Rome, i' th’ twinkling of an eye3
“Use your best speed· and mend your pace· ,

Some other ‚else will take your place.''

- Whether the sweeping N orth wind blow, -

Or Winter dim the air with snow,

And shrink 1118 daylight in a span,

I needs must hurry, as I can.

In court I hasten to appear,

Where terms of law precise and clear,

Bind, 10 my eost, whate'er I say3

Το81 18 1118 crowd Ι squeeze my way,

And jostle those 11181 8111881811 move3
“How now. ‘2' 'or‘ x‘Vhither would you shove,

Mad -pated fool. ‘W' some waspish wight

Bawls with a curse3 and then, in spite,
NJ‘Vhen to Maecenas post y ou ²ride,

You 8818 801 whom you push aside ! '²

Now this I like3 to own the truth,

It 18 88 honey to my tooth.

When to the Esquilian palace come,

The gloomy burial-place 01 Rome,

A hundred people’s matters din

My tingling ears and 118111 1118 18 1

“My master Roscius begs you '11 lend

His cause assistance, and attend

The Court 01 Common Pleas ere eight

To-morrow '⁹ — “ The comniittee wait

Your presence on some 81818 affair3

And hope you 'll 10 1118 board repair ''—

“ Persuade MaecenaS, Sir, Ι pray

To 8881 111888 11811818 ” - If I say

“ I 'll try: '' he 1181188 and teases still

With a—“ You can, Sir, if you will.”

Seven years or 1188181 818111 have flown

. Since to Maecenas Ι was known.

Not for such purposes and ends

He ranked me with his humble friends·

But, to be seated at his side,

When in his chariot 118 would ride
