TOWN LIFE AND COUNTRY LIFE. 251

Abroad for air3 as one whom just

With chit-chat trifles he would trust.

As “ What 's o'clock ⁴? '' as wagers ran,

“ Which gladiator 's the better man ⁴? '²

“ This is a nipping morning wind

For those who leave their cloaks behind.”
Such secrets aS, for aught appears,

May safely drop in chinky ears.

Yet every day and every hour,

I 'm envied for my fancied power.

‘⁴ Our old acquaintance near him sat

In the amphitheatre3 mark that.''

“ They played together in the ring '’—
“Fortune's spoilt child '² 's the tune they sing.
Some vapouring news about the street
Is cried3 and every fool I meet

Refers to me: “ Good Sir! relate—
For you must know, that haunt the great —-
What of the Dacians ? Have you heard
Some hostile tidings ? '' Not a word. —
“ Ah! how you dearly love to jest.”

By all that 's sacred, I protest

It is a secret still, to me 1—

“ Then tell us, will Augustus fee

With Latian farms the veteran bandS,
Or quai-ter on Sicilian lands ?''

And, when most solemnly I swear

I 'm in the dark, they wink and stare 3
Of all queer mortals ever known,

For close reserve Ι stand alone.

My day of life exhausted flies

Amidst these petty miser-ies.

Yet oft my lips the wish repeat:

When shall I view my country-seat ?
And books and sleep and leisure drown
In sweet forgetfulness the town ‘?

When shall Pythagoras’ relationS,
Fresh-gathered beans, supply my rations ⁸?
And cabbage, from my garden soil,

On bacon served and dript with oil ’.Ρ
Oh, suppers! and oh, nights divine!
When snug at home, both Ι and mine
Regale3 and of the broken meat
