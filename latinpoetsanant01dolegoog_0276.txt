QUINTUS HORA TIUS FLACCUS.

My saucy slaves contented eat.

No senseless rules; we fill, at pleasure,
In goblets of unequal measure3
Whether more strong 01 head, my guest
In ample cup delights him best,

Or sips the glass 01 moderate sizo

And in his merriment is wisc.

The conversation 0110103 1100

Ι11 this our cheered sobriety.

’Τ 13 not, if such a person own

A country house or house in town;
Nor yet! 11 311011 3 dancer show

An elasticity 01 toe:

But what concerns our bosoms nigh
WVhere 18110131100 were injury:

11 111133 011 wealth or worth depend3

If truth or interest fix a friend3

Ι1 the essential good we know

And what the sum 01 good below.
While these grave matters we pursue,
My neighbour Servius takes his 0110, “
And chimes in with some old wife's fab1e3
Thus, 11 301110 simpleton at table
Praise rich Arellius' large estate,

Our friend runs on in moral prate:
Once on a time, 33 stories tell,

A country mouse‚ 111 homely cell,
Received an old friend 111·οᾶ 111 town3
Our host was thrifty, a mere clown3
Yet on the occasion did his best,
Opening his heart to treat his guest.

· And, to be short, he freely fetches

His long-eared oats and boarded vetches;
And, hospitable, 'twixt his chaps

Brings shrivelled grapes and bacon 301393,
Ηο91118 with many a tempting bit

The stranger's squeamish taste to hit3
Who pickt with dainty tooth, and sat
Fribbling‚ at whiles‚ with this and that.
While my good host on this year's straw
With corn and tates amused 1113 maw,
Leaving the dainties to his guest.

The cit, at length, the clown addrest:
