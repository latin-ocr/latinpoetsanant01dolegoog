ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

Tuscum, whose brief life is conjectured to have
fallen between 54 and 18 Β.6., was probably, like Cicer-0,
of equestriau birth. Nothing is known of his youth or
education3 but his ancestral estateS, situated at Pedum,
about eighteen. miles from Rome, and not far from
Tibur and Praeneste, were confiscated during the civil
wars. Like Vergil and Horace, however, he seems to
have come into possession of sufficient share of the
property of his fathers to afford him a comfortable sub-
sistence. He was a friend of the great patron of art and
literature, Messala, and accompanied him to Aquitania in
31, and was present at the battle of Atax which broke
the Aquitanian rebellion. - The following year he started
with Messala for the East, but his health gave out and he
returned to Rome, where, and at his farm, he spent the
rest of his days. He was closely associated with Horace
and Ovid. He wrote delightful elegieS, but only one
book of them was published during his lifetime. In six
of these were celebrated the charms and cruelties of
“ Delia.'' He had loved her before he left Rome, but
she had proved faithless. But on his return from
Corcyra, after leaving Messala, he had found her ill, and
he foi-gave her, and attended her affectionately, evidently
hoping to persuade her to accompany him to Tibur.
When a richer lover and then a husband broke off this
attachment, Tibullus found consolation in a new mis-
tress, who bore the significant name of Nemesis. The
odes of Horace seem to indicate that there was still a
third divinity, named Glycera, wh0, in spite of her name,
was not sweet to him. Horace, in an epistle to Tibullus,
{ves us a very captivating picture of Tibullus' s character.

e says:——

‘⁴ Thou wert not born a body void of mind :
Yet Heaven to thee a graceful form assigned.
Heaven gave thee richeS‚ and it gave thee more:
The art to use and to enjoy thy stote.
