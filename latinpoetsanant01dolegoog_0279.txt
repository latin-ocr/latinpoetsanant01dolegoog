A PA S TORAL ELEG' Y. 255

What beyond this could some fond nurse devise

To bless her foster-son P whose thoughts are wiso,
And graced with fiuent speech ; whom favours crown
From the high great, and, from his Muse renown ;
Abundant health ; a style of life and board

He possessed all of the blessings of life— fortune, favour
with the great, fame, a remarkable gift of genuine ·
poesy, and perfect purity of taste. He was a conservative,
attached to old customS, gentle and genial, a passionate

elegies was published after his death. Still a third book,
sometimes published under his name, is attributed to an
inferior poet named Lygdamus, who may have been a
friend of his. A fourth book is made up of poenis by
different hanHS, some of which may have been Tibullus’S.

And firstling fruit-s upon his altar lay.

Still let thy temple's porch, Ο Ceres! wear
The spiky garland from my harvest field3
And, midst my orchard, against the birds of air,
His threatening hook let red Priapus wieldl
