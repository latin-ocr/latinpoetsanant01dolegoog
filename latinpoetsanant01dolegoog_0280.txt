256 ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

Ye too, once guardians of a rich domain,
Now of poor fields, domestic Gods l , be kind!
Then, for unnumbered herds, a calf was slain;
Now to your altars is a lamb consignedl

The mighty victim of a scanty soil,
A ‘lamb alone shall bleed before your shrine3

While round it shout the youthful sons of toil,
“ Hail Ξ grant the harvest! grant the generous wine!'’

Content with little, I no more would tread
The lengthening mad, but shun the Summer day,
Where some o'erbranching tree might shade my head3
And watch the murmuring rivulet glide away.

Nor could Ι blush to wield the rustic prong,
The lingering oxen goad3 or some stray lamb,
Embosomed in my garment, bear along,
Or kid forgotten by its heedless dam.

Spare my small flocks! ye thieveS‚ and wolves, assail
· The wealthier coteS, that ampler booty hold;

N e'er for my Shepherd due lustrations fai13
I soothe with milk the Goddess of the fold.

Be present, Deities! nor gifts disdain
From homely board3 nor cups with scorn survey,
Earthen‚ yet pure3 for such the ancient swain
Formed for himself and shaped of ductile clay.

I envy not my sires their golden heap3

Their garners' floors with sheafy corn bespread3 *
Few sheaves suffice: enough, in easy sleep

To lay my limbs upon the accustomed bed.

How sweet! to hear, without, the howling blast,
And strain a yielding mistress to my breast Ξ
Or, when the gusty torrent's rush has past,
Sink, lulled by beating rains, to sheltered rest!

Be this my lot3 be his the unenvied store,

Who the drear storm endures and raging seas 3
Ah 1 perish emeralds and the golden ore,

If the fond anxious nymph must weep for me.
