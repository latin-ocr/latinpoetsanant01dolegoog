ELEGY TO DELIA. 259

Slaves —all shall own her undisputed rule3

Myself a cipher — how the thought would please!
Here will Messala oome, for whom she 'll pull

The sweetest apples from the ohoieest trees.

And honouring one so great, for him prepare
And serve the banquet with her own white hands.
Fond dream! which now the East and South wind bear
Away to far Armenia’s spioy lands.

—Translation of «huns CRANsrouu.
