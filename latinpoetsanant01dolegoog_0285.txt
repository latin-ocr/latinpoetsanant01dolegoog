A FESTJVAL DAY. 261

affections received some of her trinkets, it has been con-
jectured that she died under his protecting care. It is
supposed that he married, for he left legitimate issue
mentioned by Pliny. He lived on the Esquiline not far

. from the gardens of Maecenas. Here he must have fre-

quently met the great poets of his ‘day3 but while he
speaks of having heard parts of the AEneid read aloud,
he never mentions Horace, Tibullus, or Ovid. Yet Ovid
speaks of him in tei-ms of warm affection. Apparently
he was urged to drive his Muse to epic ambitionS, but he
replied:— ‘

‘⁶ Enough‚ with sweet Callimachus to please,
froissssiiffigssa'zi?‘affirm{affss’wissss‘ffiasffi
Be hailed divine, and homage meet. receive.'’

And again: —

‘⁶ As when we cannot reaoh the head of statues all too high,
We lay a chaplet at the feet, so now perforce do Ι,
Unfit, to climb the giddy heights of epic song divine,
In humble adoration lay poor incense on thy shrine:
For not as yet my Muse hath known the wells of Ascra's grove :
Permessus' gentle wave alone hath laved the limbs of Love.”

But in the fifth book of his Elegies he made redactions of
some of his earlier poeinS, aud sang of the glories of old
Rome with what Dean Merivale calls “a strength and
sometimes a grandeur of language which would have
been highly relished in the sterner age of LucretiuS.'’
These poems may have suggested to ovid <the plan of his
“Fasti,'' or “Annals in Verse.'' Propertius died early,
the date assigned being the year 15. His lack of com·
parative popularity is shown hythe fact that there are
no selections from his works in any of the Latin antholo-
gies, But· in spite of his obscurities and the difficulties
of his learned allusions there is fine poetry in his Elegies.

A FESTIVAL DAY.

Tms festal day let soil and tiller rest!
Hang up the share, and give all ploughing o’er3
Unstrap the yokes. Each ox, with chaplets drest,
'Should feed at large a well-filled stall before.
