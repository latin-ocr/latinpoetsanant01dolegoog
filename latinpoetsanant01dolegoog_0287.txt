LOVE THE WINGED ARCHER. 263

But spate him, brothers! the repentant youth
Gives his free promise now of amorous truth:
And see, we reach ‘che appointed house‚'' he said:
Then my stript mantle o’er my shoulders spread,
And led me in: “ Go now: no longer roam:

But learn from this to pass thy nights at home.''

LOVE THE WINGED AROHER.

ΗΑΒ he not hands of rare device, whoe'er
First painted Love in figure of a boy ⁴?
He saw what thoughtless beings lovers were,
Who blessings lose whilst lightest cares employ.

Nor added he those airy wings in vain,

And bade through human hearts the godhead fly3
For we are ‘nost upon a wavering main3

Our gale, inconstant, veers around the sky.

Nor, without cause, he grasps those barbed dartS,
The Cretan quiver o'er his shoulder oast3

Ere we suspect a foe, he strikes our hearts3
And those inflioted wounds for ever last.

In me are fixt. ‘chose arrows— in my breast3
But sure his wings are show, the boy remains3
For never takes he ssight, 1101· knows he rest3
Still, still I feel him warring through my veinS.

In these sooroh‘o vitals dost thou joy to dwell ?
Oh shame 1 to others let ‘chy arrows flee3
Let veins untouoh'c with all thy venom swe113

Not me thou torturest, but the shade of me.

Destroy me — who shall then describe the· fair ἵ)
This my light Muse to thee high glory brings:
When the nymphs' tapering finget-s, flowinghair,
And eyes of jen, and gliding feet, she singS.
-— Translation of sm CRARLES ABRAHAM Emon.
