264 SEXTUS A URELIUS PR OPER TIUS.

TO TULLUS.
THE s‘rmos OF Lovn.

CYNTHIA'S ensnaring eyes my bondage tied:
Ah wretoh 1 no loves till 111611 had 10116111 my breast3

Love beni] 1ο earth 111686 looks of stedfast pride,
And on my neck his foot triumphant} prest.

He taught me, then, to loathe 1116 virtuous fair,
And shameless waste my wild and driftless hours3
Twelve moons 11118 madness lasts3 and yet my prayer
Is breathed in hopeless love to adverse powers.

Minalion, 6181, could all adventures brave,
Till Atalanta's barbarous heart grew mild3
Love-orazed‚ he tried eaoh drear Parthenian eave,
And lookt on shaggy beasts in forests wildl

Struok by the branoh 1116 1110118116118 Centaur swayed,
Midst shrill Arcadia's rocks he groaning fe113

And thus he tamed 1116 nimble-footed maid3
Thus love-prayers speed‚ and 3618 that merit well!

In me no arts ean tardy Love devise;
His foot ean traok no more 1116 beaten ways:
Come ye! that draw 1116 Moon from chat-med skieS,
That bid the hearth 111 magio orgies blaze.

Come! 111111 a haughty mistress' marble heart,
And change her oheek, 81111 paler than my own:
Then will Ι trust that stars obey your art,
And rivers rush, by muttered verse alone.

Friends! that too late my sliding feet recall,
Some antidote 1ο this my frenzy bear:

Bring 81661; bring flames and raoks: I brave 1116111 a113
But 161 1116 freely vent my fieroe despair.

Oh snabch me 1ο 1116 world's 1611101681 shore!
Oh waft me o'er the immeasurable main!

Where never woman may behold me more,
Nor brace my way, 1ο sting with her disdain.
