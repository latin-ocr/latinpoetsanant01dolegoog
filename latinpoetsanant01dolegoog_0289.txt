IN SPI ΗΑ TI ΟΝ To S ΟΝ G. 265

Stay ye‚ to whom the listening God eonsents;
Safe in an equal yoke of fondness move3
But Venus all my bitter nights torments3
N o—-not 6 single hour is free from love!

Beware my sufferings : hold the mistress (1661

Whose faith is tried, nor shift the aeeustomed sway3
If to my voice ye bend 6 81013111111 661,

What pangs shall my remembered words eonvey.

CYNTHIA DANCING.

’Τ WAs not her 1606, though fair, so 81110136 my eye
(Less fair 13116 11151 1311611 my love: as snows

01 Scythia with Iberian vei-mile vie;
As float in milk the petals 01 13116 1086),

Nor looks that down her neck 01 110151 stream,

Nor eyes —my stars—twin lamps with love aglow3
Nor 11 111 silk 01 Araby she gleam

(I prize not baubles), does she 13111111 1116 80

Α8 when she leaves the mantling cup to thread
The mazy danee, and moves before my view,
Graeeful 68 blooming Ariadne led
The 0110161 161618 01 13116 Β6001110 01611,

Or wakes the Inte-strings with AEolian quill
To musio worthy 01 the immortal Nine,

And challenges renowned Corinna's skill,
And rates her own above Erinna's line.

INSPIRATION ΤΟ SONG.

Yon ask me why love-elegy so frequently I follow,
And why my little book of tendet· trifles only sings:
It is not from Calliope, nor is it from Apollo,
But from my own sweet lady-love my inspiration
springs,
