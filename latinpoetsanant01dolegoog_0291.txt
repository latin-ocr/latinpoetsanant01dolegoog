LOVE’S SHIP WRECK. 267

LOVE'S SHIPWRECK.

Rmmmr I 'm set-ved, who had the beart to fly!
Το 1119 10119 halcyone here I make my moan:

Nor shall my keel its wonted port draw nigh—
Adrift on thankless shore my vows are thrown.

Nay‚ more! the adverse winds espouse thy side!
Lo! in rude gusts how fiercely chides the galei

Will no sweet Peace 0' er yon wild tempest ride?
Must these few sands to hide my eorpse avail. ‘²

Nay‚ change thy harsh complaints for milder 1011981
Let night on yonder shoals my pardon buy.

Thou wilt not brook to leave unul-ned my bones:
Thou wilt 1101 face my loss with tearless eye.

Ah! perish he who first with raft and sail

The whirlpools of a hostile deep essayed!
Liefer I 'd let my Cynthia's whims plevail,

And tarried with a hard, yet 111910111988, 1119111-

Τ11911 80911 9 811019 with unknown forests girt,
And 8119111 1111119 eyes the weleome 'lxvius to sight.

At home had Fate but stilled my bosom' 8 burt,
And one last stone 0' er buried love lain light,

She should have shorn her tresses o’ 91· my tomb‚
And laid my bones to rest 011 cnshioned rose,

Called the deal· name above the (lust of (loom,
And bade me 'neath the sod uncrusht repose.

Daughters of Doris, 191191118 of the deep,
Unfurl the white 8911 with propitious hand3

If e'er sly Love did 'neath your waters creep,
Oh! grant a fellow-slave a kindly strand.
