268 SEXTUS AURELIUS PROPERTIUS.

A HINT or JEALOUSY.

Wmm thou to lounge mid Baiae's haunts art fain,
Neai· road first trackt by toiling Hercules»,
Admiring now Thesprotus' old domain,
Now famed Misenum, hanging o'er the seas3

Say, dost thou care for me, who watch alone ⁶?
In thy love's corner hast thou room to spate?

Or have my lays from thy remembrance flown,
Some treacherous stranger finding harbour there ⁴?

Rather Ι 'd deem that, trusting tiny oar,
Τ hou guidest slender skiff in Lucrine wave3
Or in a sheltered creek‚ by 'Teuthras' shore,
Dost cleave thy bath, as in lone ocean cave,

Than for seductive whispers leisure find,
Reclining softly on the silent sarid,

And mutual gods clean banish from thy mind,
As flirt is wont‚ no chaperon near at hand.

Ι know, of course, thy blameless character,
Yet in thy fond behalf all court Ι fear.
Ah! pardon if my verse thy choler stir‚
, Blame but my jealous care for one· so dear.

Mother and life beneath thy love I prize‚
Cynthia to me is home, relations, bliss;

Come I to friends with bright or downcast eyes-
'T is Cynthia's mood is the sole cause of this.

Ah ! let her, then, loose Baiae’s snares eschew—
Oft from its gay parades do quarrels spring,
And shores that oft have made true love nntrue:

A curse on them, for lovers' hearts they wring.

— Translation os JAMES Davum
