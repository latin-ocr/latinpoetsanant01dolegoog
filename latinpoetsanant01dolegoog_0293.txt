CORNELIA. 269

LOVE’ S FAREWELL.·

AT board and banquet have Ι been a jest,
And whoso chose might point a gibe at me;
Fun five years didst thou my stanch service test,
Now shalt thou bite thy nails to find me free.

I mind not tears———unmoved by trick so stale3
Cynthia, thy tears from artful motives flow3

I weep to part, but wrongs o'er sobs prevai13
’T is thou hast dealt love's yoke its crushing blow.

Threshold‚ adieu, that pitied my distreSS,

And door that took no hurt from angered hand;
But thee, false woman, may the inroads press

Of years, whose wrack in vain wilt thou withstand.

Ay, seek to pluck the hoar hairs from their root 3 —
Lo, how the mirror chides thy wrinkled face!
Now is thy turn to reap pride's bitter fruit,
And find thyself in the despised one's place:

Thrust out, in turn, to realize disdain,
And, what thou didst in bloom, when sere lament:
Such doom to thee foretells my fateful strain3
Hear, then, and sear, thy beauty's punishment.

— Translation os JAxn‘s Duras,

 

CORNELIA.

Am) now Ι leave thee as a sacred trust,

That common pledge, our children3 for this care,
Branded into my dust, yet breathes and lives.
Hereafter thou, their father, take for them

A mother's office; for thy neck must bear

The load of all my loved ones, When thou givest
Thy kisses as they weep, add too their mother’s.
Thine is the burden of the household now.

If thou have sorrow, let them see thee not;
Beguile them, when they come, with tearless cheeks
And fond caresses. Be it enough for thee

To weary the long nights with thoughts of me,

And, the ybeholding of my form 111 dreams
