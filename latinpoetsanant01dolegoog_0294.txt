270 SEXTUS AURELIUS PROPERTIUS.

So, when thou'speakest to my sacred shade,
Think thou hast answer to thine every word.
But now, whether it be the door Ι knew

Open upon an altered wedding-couch,

And a stepmother sit where I sat once,

Speak well, my children, of your father's wife,
And bear her yoke3 before your winniug ways
It must be that her charmed heart will yield.
Also praise not your mother over much, ’

For your new parent, matcht with her of old,
Will think scorn of your free and innocent speech-
Or if my shade content him, and he think

My ashes of such price, learn well to mark

The coming of old age, and leave no room

For cares to enter which beset the life

Of single men. The number of the years
Which I have lost, Heaven add unto your days·
And so may Paullus, with my offspring left,
Love to be old. And it is well—for never
Clothed Ι myself in mouruing for a child.

None, none was absent from my funeral rites.
But 1 have said. Plead for me ye that weep
While grateful Earth pays back the price of life.
Yea, Heaven itself hath opened to the good.
And may my bones, for all that I have wrought,
Ride on triumphant to the fields of rest!

—Translation os Pmur Suu-nors Wonsmr.

 

LOVE AND SCIENCE.

Losa as of youth the joyous hours remain,

Me may Castalia's sweet recess detain,

Fast by the umbi-ageous vale lulled to reposo,
Where Aganippe wat-bles as it fiows3

Or roused by sprightly sounds from out the trance,
I 'd in the ring knit hands and join the Muses' dance.
Give me to send the laughing bowl around

My soul in Bacchus' pleasing fetters bound3

Let on this head unfading flowers reside,

There blooms the vernal rose's earliest pride3

And when, our flames commissioned to destroy,

Age step twixb Love and me, aud intercepta the joy,
