LOVE AND SC'IENC'E. 271

When my changed head these locks no lore shall know,
And all its jetty honours turn to snow3

Then let me rightly spell of Nature's ways;

To Providence, to Him my thoughts I 'd raise,

Who taught 11116 vast machine its steadfast 16116,
Τ1161 11161 61611161, universal Cause3

8661011 10 111161 regions yonder Star 1611166,

Τ1161 monthly waning hides her paly 11166,

And whence, 611611 revived, with silver light
Relumes her crescent orb to 011661· 1116 dreary night:
How rising winds the face 01 006611 sweep,

Where lie the eternal fountains 01 1116 deep,

And whence 13116 cloudy magazines maintain

Their wintry war or pour the autumnal rain3

How flameS, perhapS, 111111 (1116 confusion hurled, -ι,
811611 sink this beauteous fabric of the world3

What colours paint the vivid arch of J ove;

What wondrous force the solid earth can move,
When Pindus' 6611 approaching ruin (1166(16,

Shakes all his pines and bows his hundred heads;
Why does yon Orb, so exquisitely bright,

Obscure 1116 16(1161106 111 6 short-lived night3
Whence the seven Sisters' congregated fires

And what Bootes’ lazy wagon tires;

How the rude surge its sandy bounds control;

Who measured out the year, and bade the seasons roll;
If realms beueath those fabled torments know,
Pangs without respite, fires that ever glow,

Earth's monster brood stretcht on their iron bed,
The hissing terrors round Alecto's head,

Scarce to nine 60166 Tityus' bulk confined,

The triple dog that scares the shadowy kind,

All angry Heaven inflictS, or Hell can feel,

The pendent rock, Ixion's whirling wheel,

‘Famine at feasts, and thirst amid the stream;

Or are our 16616 the enthusiasts' empty dream,

And all the scenes that hurt the grave’s repose,

But pictured horror and poetic woes.

These 6011 inglorious joys my 1101116 engage;

Be Love my youth's pursuit and Science crowu my Age.
You whose young bosonis feel a nobler flame
Redeem what Crassus lost and vindicate his name.
