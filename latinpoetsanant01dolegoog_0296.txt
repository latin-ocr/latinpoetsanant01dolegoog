PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Ovm was born March 20, 43 Β.6., at Sulm0, now Sol-
mona, a picturesque spot “abounding in cool waters,''
among the Apennines, about ninety miles northeast
from Rome. His father belonged to the equestrian
order, and seems to have been a practical, hard-headed
man of business, who had little sympathy with his son's
poetical proclivitieS, reminding him that Maeonian Homer
wasssenniless. He and his brother Lucius were carefully
educated, and he was destined to practise law in the Roman
courts. The death of Lucius doubled his prospects and
freed him from the necessity of labour. He had some
ability in oratory. Seneca, remarking that when he took
pains he was a good declaimer‚ added that his discourse
resembled a solutum carmen, “ free and easy verse or im-
* provisation.'' After studying rhetoric at Rome, he went
to Athens and became thoroughly familiar with Greek.
He travelled extensively in Asia and Sicily, afterward
utilizing his acquaintance with the scenes of legend and
romance to enrich his poems. He returned to Rome and
became one of the judges who tried will suits and 691116-
times crimina] cases; he was even promoted to be one of
the “decemviri,'' or presiding officers of that court. He
was twice married in early life, but both wives were
speedily divorced. It is a question whether the Corinna
whom he celebrates in his three books of “ Amores ''
was a real person. It has been conjectured that she was
J ulia, the dissolute daughter of the Emperor Augustus.
Some think that this mistress was only a fiction.

As a poet he was extremely popular. Even as a
youth he began to recite his verses in public. He
mingled *in the fashionable literary set, and after his
happy marriage with his third wife he lived in a com-
fortable house near the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter.
Here his daughter Perilla was born. He also had a
summer home at Sulmo. While he was on the island Α
of Elba, in the year 9 A.D.‚ he received a command
