PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO. 273

from the emperor to betake himself to Tomi, a town on
the Euxine, south of the mouths of the Danube, on the
very border of the empire. The ostensible reason was
the publication of his “Ars Amatoria.'' But although
Augustus commanded this to be expelled from the libra·
ries, it had been published ten years previously. The real
cause of his exile will never be known. He describes in
one of his poems the tragedy of his banishment. His
wife was left in Rome to scheme for the revocation of
the sentence. But 116 was not recalled. Tomi was a
small, disagreeable place, exposed to attacks from the bar·
barianS, and so cold in winter that wine froze. He wrote
from there many letters to friends, complaining of his
fate; these poetical epistles are full of pathetic pictures
of his unhappiness. He amused himself in ,learning the
language of the Getae among whom he lived, and com-

by this people that they freed him from all public service.
He died in exile 18 Aa), Ovid was a voluminous writer.
Besides his love poems and the epistolary and other com-
plaints of his exile, his best-known work is the fifteen
books of “ The Metamorphoses,” in which he embodied
in graceful verse many of the myths of the Greeks and
Romans, These are woven into a continuous poem of
considerable unity with much skill. He also wrote a
tragedy entitled “ Medea,” which was very successfu13
only two lines of it are left. Ovid probably compesed
too spontaneously and fiuently to accomplish the most
perfect results, He was hardly a great poet, and of late
years 116 has been rather neglectcd. In the seventeenth
century he was even more popular than Vergil. Zachary
Catlin called him “ the Muses’ favourite and white sun,''
and Wye Saltonstall, in one of the dainty little volumes
which contain his translations of the “Elegies and Let-
terS‚'’ thus vented his enthusiasm :—

“ Of all the Poets that in verse did raigne
As MonarchS‚ none could equall Ovid's straine,
Especially in the affaires of Love
Ovid the Master of that Art did prove.
His fancies were so pleasing and so sweet
That Love did wish 110 other winding sheet,
If 116 had mortall beene‚ for he would dyo

· To live again in his Sweet Poesie.”
