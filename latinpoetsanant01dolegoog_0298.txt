ΟΕ· bodies ohang'd to other shapes I sing.
· Assist, you Gods (from you these changes spring)
And, from the Worlds first fabriek to these 1111103,
Deduoe my never-discontinued Rymes.
The Sea, the Barth, all eovering Heaven vnfram’d,
One faoe had Nature, which they Chaos nam'd:
An vndigested lump, a barren load,
Where jari-ing seeds of things ill-joyn'd aboad.
No Titan yet the world with light adornes3
Nor waxing Phoebe fill'd her wained hornes:
Nor hung the sels-poiz’d Earth in thin Ayre plao'd3
Nor Amphitrite the vast shore imbrao’d.

With strifelesse peace He to their seats oonfin'd.
Forth-with vp-sprung the quiok and waightlesse Fire,
Whose flames vnto the highest Aroh aspiret
The next, in levitie and place, is Ayre:
Grosse Elements to thioker Earth repayre
Selfe-clog'd with waight: the VVaters flowing round,
Possesse the last, and solid Tellus bound.

What God soeuer this division wrought,
And every part to due proportion brought3
First,least the Earth vnequall should appeare,
He turn'd it round, in figure of a Sphea1·e;
Then, Seas diffus'd3 commanding them to roare
With ruffling Winds‚ and giue the Land a shore.
To those he addeth Springs, PondS, Lakes immense'3
And Riuers„ whom their winding borders fenee:
Of these, now* few Earth's thirsty jawes devoute:
