THE CREA TI ΟΝ. 275

The rest, the streames into the Ocean poure3
When in that liquid Plaine, with freer waue,
The foamie Oliffes, in stcad of Banks, they lane:
Bids Trees increase to Woods, the Plaines extend,
The rocky Mountaynes rise, and Vales descend.
Two equall ZoneS, on eitherside, dispose
The measur'd Heauens; a fifth, more hot then those.
As many Lines th' included Globe divide:
I' th' midst vnsufferable beams reside3
Snow clothes the other two: the temperate hold
'Twixt these their seats, the Hcat well mixt with Cold.
As Eat-th, as Water, vpper Ayre ont-waighs;
So much doth Ayre Fire’s lighter balance raise.
There, He com mands the changing Clouds to stray3
There, thundering tert-ors mortall miudes dismay3
And with the Lightning, Winds ingendring Snow:
Yet not permitted every way to blow3
Who hardly now to teare the World refraine
(So Brothers jai-re !) though they divided raigne,
To Persis and Sabbaea, Eurus flies3
Whose gums pei-sume the blushing Mornes vp—rise:
Next to the Evening, and the Coast that glowes
With Setting Phoebus, flowrie Zeplz’rus blowes:
In Scythia horrid Boreas holds his raigne,
Beneath Bo’o'tes and the frozen Waine:
The Laud to this oppos'd, doth Auster steepe
With fruitfull showres, and clouds which ever weepe.
Abone all these He plac't the liquid Skies3
Which, void of earthly dregs, did highest rise.
Scarce had He all thus orderly dispos'd3
WVhen as the Starres their radiant heads disclos'd
(Long hid in N ight) and shone through all the skie.
Then that no place should vnpossessed lie
Bright Constellations, and faire figured Gods,
In heauenly Mansions fixt their blest abodes:
The glitteting Fishes to the Floods repayre3
The Beasts to Earth, the Birds resort to Ayre.
The nobler Creature, with a mind possest,
Was wanting yet, that should command the rest.
That Maker, the best World’s originall,
Either Him fram'd of seed Caelestia113
Or Earth, which late he did from Heauen diuide,

Some sacred seeds retain’d, to Heauen ally’d;
