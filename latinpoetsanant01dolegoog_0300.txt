276 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Which with the liuing streame Prometheus mixt3
And in that artificiall structure fixt
The forme of all th' all-ruling DeitieS.
And whereas others see with down-caste eyeS,
He with a loftie looke did Man indue,
And bade him heauens transcendent glories view.
Se, that rude Clay, which had no forme afore,

, Thus ehang'd, of Man the vnknowne figure bore.

— Translation of Gnoson SANDYS (ed. of 1632).

 

PATIENCE AN D TACT.

“Tim Am· 01²* Lovn.”

. WITH Parthians, war3 but with thy maiden prove
Soft peace, light wit, and every cause of love.
Though harsh, uncou1¹teouS‚ she withhold eonsent3
Persist, be patient, she shall yet relent.

The tree’s bent branch by gentle training plies;
Urge your whole strength, it rudely snaps and flies;
By gentle force your arms the stream divide,
For vainly would you stem the hurrying tide.
Tigers to this, Numidian lions, bow3
This tames the bull, and yokes him to the plough.
Than Atalanta who more fieree of mood ?
A lover’s soft deserts that scorn subdued.
Though oft Milanion, underneath the tree‚
⁴ Wept his hard hap, and maiden's eruelty3
Ost on his neck the huntress' toils were laid3
Ost his fell spear the grimly boar assayed3
And once a Centaur's arrow winged the wound‚
Yet Love's keen arrow was more painful found.
I- bid thee not to javelins bare thy heart;
Soft are the cautious of thy master’s art.
Still stoop to conquer3 when she thwarts thee yield3
Do all her hidding, thou shalt win the field.
Thus, when she argues, argue on her side3
What she approves approve3 deny what she denied3
Say and unsay3 and, as her face appears,
Smile on her smileS, and weep upon her tearS.
If with ill throw she east the ivory die,

:rhrow with ui blek} be hers the victory ὅ
