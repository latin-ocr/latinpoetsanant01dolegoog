PA TIENCE AND TACT: 277

Ne'er with good cast a lucky vengeance take3

But throw ace-point3 be thine the losing stake.

Or, when the chessman moves in mock campaign,
Thy pawn should by its glassy foe be slain.

Her rod-distended parasol display3

Make the rude crowd before her steps give way3
Affix the footstool to her slight sett'ee3

Be the slid slipper placed, displaced, by thee.

Oft, though thyself be shivering with the cold,

Her hand within thy bosom, chafing, hold3

Nor think it mean, such 111661111633 charms, to bear,
Though nobly bred, the mirror of the fair.

When bidden to the square, obedient start

At earlier 110111, 61111, linger-ing, late depart.

Run,‚to whatever place3 all else defer3

Not crowds should stay thee, when thou fliest to her.
At night, the banquet o'er‚ she seeks her home,

And calls her slave3 do thou, obsequious, come.

Or, should she bid thee from 1116 111161 3116116,

Love hates the slothful, be the call obeyed.

If wheels be wanting, take on foot thy way3

No lowering weather should thy haste delay 3

No parching dog-star heat3 no whitening track,

That leads through deepening snow-driftS, hold thee back.
Love is like war: ye faint of heart! begone!

No coward hands must 11661 0111 standai-ds on.

In these soft camps are countless labours found3
Night‚ tempest, joui-neyings‚ many a grief and wound.
The clouds shall drench thee with aeria] rain,

And thy cold limbs shall press the unsheltered plain.
Are level open ways thy feet denied ἱ)

To bari-icaded 110013 616 110113 applied ?

Yet the free roof is open to the sky3

Drop, or through stealthy windows slide from high.
Thy hair-breadth ’scapes the nymph shall pleased approve3
Herself the cause, and this thy pledge of love.
