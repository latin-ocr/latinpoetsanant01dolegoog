278 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

THE REMEDY FOR HOPELESS LOVE.

SAPPno’s LETTER ’10 ΡΗΑΟΝ.

Α. 31111116 111616 is, where silver waters show

Clear as a glass, 1116 shining sands below;

A flowery 101113 spreads 113 311113 above,

Shades all 1116 banks, and seems itself a grove:
Eternal greens 1116 mossy margin grace,

Watched by 1116 sylvan genius of 1116 place.

Here as Ι lay, and swelled with 16313 1116 flood,
Before my sight a watery virgin stood:

She stood and cried, “ Oh, you 11131 love in vain,
Fly hence, and seek 1116 fair Leucadian main!
There stands a rock, from whose impending steep
Apollo's fane surveys 1116 10111118 116611;

There injured lovers, leaping from above,

Their flames extinguish and forgel: 10 love.
Deucalion once, with hopeless fury burned,

In vain he loved, 16161111633 Pyrrha scorned:

But when from hence he plunged into 1116 main,
Deucalion scorned 31111 Pyrrha loved in vain.
Hence, 831111110, 113316 l from high Leucadia throw
Thy wretched weight, 1101· dread 1116 1166113 below.’'
She spoke, and vanisht with 1116 voice -’- I rise‚
And silent 16313 fall trickling from my eyes.

Ι 80, ye nymphs, those rocks and 3633 10 prove:
And much I fear3 11111 ah! how much Ι lovel

Ι 80, ye nymphs, where furious love inspire83
Let female fears 3111111111 10 female fires.

To rocks and 3633 Ι fly from Phaon's hate,

And hope from 3633 31111 rocks a milder fate.

Ye gentle gales, below my.body blow,

And softly lay me on 1116 waves below!

And 111611, kind Love‚ my sinking limbs 311313111,
81116311 thy soft wingS, and waft me o'er 1116 main,
Nor 161 3 lover's death 1116 8111111633 flood profane! ,
011 Phoebus' shrine my harp I 'll then bestow,
And this inscription shall be placed below —

“ Here she who sung 10 him 11131 did inspire,
Sappho 10 Ρ110611113 601136613163 1161 lyre3

What suits with Sappho, Phoebus, suits with 11166-
Τ116 gift, 1116 giver, and 1116 8011 38166.”
