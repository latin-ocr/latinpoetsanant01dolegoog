ᾼ OAPTIVE or Lovn.

WHA'r makes my bed seem hard, seeing it is soft ἶ)
Or why slips down the coverlet so oft ⁴?

Although the nights be long, Ι sleep not through3
My sides are sore with tumbling to and fro.

Were Love the cause, it 's like I should descry him3
Or lies he close, and shoots where none can spy him ἱ)
’Τ was so; he struck3 he struck me with a slender dart3
’Τ 13 611161 Love turmoils my captive heart.

Yielding or struggling, do we give him might ἱ)

Let 's yield: a burden easily borne 13 light!

I saw a brandisht fire increase 111 strength3

Which being not shaked, Ι saw it die at length.
Young oxen newly yoked are beaten more

Than oxen which have drawn the plough before3
And rough jades' mouths with stubborn bits are torn3
But managed horses' heads are lightly borne.
Unwilling lovers Love doth more torment

Than such as in their bondage feel content.

Le, Ι 60111633, I am thy captive, Ι 1

And hold my conquered hands for thee to tie.

What needst thou war ⁴? Ι 3116 to thee for gracez
With arms to conquer armless men is base!

Yoke Venus' doves, put myrtles on thy hair:

Vulcan will give thee chariots rich and fair.

The ,people thee applauding, thou shalt stand,
Guiding the harmless pigeons with thy hand ε

Young men and women 3116115 1511011 166(1 63 thrall;

So will thy triumph seem magnifical ε

Ι, lately caught, will have a new-made wound,

And captive-like be manicled and bound:

Good meaning, shame and such as seek Love's wrack,
Shall follow thee, their hands tied at their back:
Thee all shall fear and worship as a king3
I'o-triumphing shall thy people sing3

Smooth speeches, Fear, and Rage shall by thee ride,
Which troops have always been on Cupid's side:
Thou with these soldiers conquer'st Gods and men 3
Take these away, where is thine honour then ?

Thy mother shall from Heaven applaud this show,
And 011 their faces heaps of 10363 strowe
