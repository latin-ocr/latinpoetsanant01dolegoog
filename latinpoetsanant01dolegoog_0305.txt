ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF CORINNA'S PARROT. 281

With beauty of thy wings thy 1311· 11311 81111611,
Ride‚ golden Love‚ in chariot richly builded.
Unless I err, full many shalt thou burn,

And give wounds infinite at every turn:

In spite of thee, forth will thine arrows fly3

A scorching flame burns all the standers-by.

So having conquered Ind, was Bacchus' hue :
Thee 'pompous birds, and him two tigers drew.
Then, seeing 1 grace thy show in following thee,
Forbear to hurt thyself in spoiling me.

Behold thy kinsman Caesar's prosperous 11311113.
Who guards the conqueror with his conquering hands.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF CORINNA'S PARROT.

ΤΗΕ Ρ31101, 110111 East India to me sent,

Is dead: 311 101113, her exequies frequent.

Go, godly birds, striking your breastS, bewail‚

And with rough claws your tender cheeks assail!
For 1101111 113113 161 piece-torn plumes abound3

For 10118 31111111 trum pets let your notes resound !
Why, Philomel, dost Tereus' lewdness mourn?
All-wasting years have that complaint now worn:
Thy tunes let 11113 1316 bird’s sad funeral borrow,
Itys a great, but ancient, cause 01 sorrow.

All you whose pinions in the clear air soar,

But most thou· friendly turtle-dove‚ deploret

Full concord all your lives was you betwixt,

And to the end your constant 131111 310011 fixt3
What Pylades did to Orestes prove,

Such to the parrot was the turtle-dove!

But what availed this 131111 ? Her rarest hue ?

Or voice that how to change the wild notes knew?
What 1161113 11 111011 11611 given to please my wench. ‘⁷
Birds’ hapless glory, death thy life doth quench.
Γ111011 with thy quills mightst make green emeralds dark,
And pass our scailet 01 1611 saffron’ s mark.

No such voice-seigning bird was on the ground3
Thou spok'st thy words so well‘ with stammering sound.
