282 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Envy hath rapt thee: 110 fierce wars thou movedst3
Vain-babbling speech and pleasant peace thou lovedst.
Behold, how quails among their battles live,
Which do perchance old age unto' them give.
A little filled thee3 and, for love of talk,
Thy mouth to 16616 01 many meats did balk.
Nuts were thy food and poppy caused thee sleep ;
Pure water's moisture thirst away did keep.
The ravenous vulture lives3 the puttock hovers
Around the air3 the cadess rain discovers3
And crows survive arms -bearing Pallas' hate,
Whose life 111116 6366 666106 bring out of date.
Dead 16 11161 speaking image of man' s voice,
The parrot given me, the 131 world' s best' 6110166.
The greedy spirits take the best things first,
Supplying their void places with the worst.
Thersites did Protesilaus survive;
And Hector died, his brothers yet alive!
My wench's vows 101 thee· what should I show,
Which stormy South winds into sea did blow ⁴?
The seventh day came3 none following mightst thou see3
And the Fate' s distaff emp ty stood to thee.
Yet wor'ds 111 thy benumbedy palate rung;

“,Farewell Corinna,'' cried thy dying 10113116.
Elysium hath a wood of holm -trees black,

ν Whose earth doth not perpetual green grass lack.

There good birds rest (if we believe things hidden),
WVhence unclean fowls are said to be forbidden.

x There harmless swans feed all abroad the river 3

There lives the phoenix, one alone bird ever3

There Juno²s bird displays h'is gorgeous feather,
And loving doves kiss eagerly together.

The pai-rot, into wood received with these,

Turns all the godly birds to what she please.

A grave her bones hides: 011 1161 corps' great grave
The little stones these little verses have:—

leis tomb appi-oves I pleased ‘my ‘mistress well ;

1113] mouth. in speakinq did all birds excel.
