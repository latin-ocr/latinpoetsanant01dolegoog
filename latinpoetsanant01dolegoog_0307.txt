Smn of my too presumptuous fleme,
To fairest Celia haste, nor linger,
And may she gladly breathe my name,
And gayly put thee on her finger!

Suis. her as I myself, that she

May fondle thee with murmured blessing3
Caressed by Celia! Who could be
Unenvious of such sweet oaressing ⁴?

Had I Medea's magio art,
Or Proteus* power of transformation,
Then would Ι blithely play thy part,
The happiest trinket in creationi

Oh! on her bosom I would fall,

Her finger guiding all too lightly3
Or else be magically small,

Fearing to be disearded ssightly.

And Ι her ruby lips would kiss

(What mortal's fortune could be better ?)
As oft allowed 130 seal my bliss

As she desires to seal a letter.

Now g0‚ these are delusione bright
Of idle Faney's idlest soheming5

Tell her to read the token right —
Tell her how sweet is true love’s dreaming.
