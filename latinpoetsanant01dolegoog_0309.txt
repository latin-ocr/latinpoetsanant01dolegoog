ELEGY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF TIBULLUS. 285

Scarce of 30 great a soul, thus lowly laid,
Enough remains to fill this little urn3
Ο holy bard! were not the flames afraid

That hallowed corse thus ruthlessly to burn ?

These might devour the heavenly halls that shine
With gold—they dare a villany so deep:

Sum turned who holds the Erycinian shrine,
And there are some who say she turned to weep. ·

Yet did the base soil of a stranger land
Not hold him nameless; as the spirit fled
His mother closed his eyes with gentle hand,
And paid the last sad tribute to the dead. ·

Here, with thy wretched mother's woe to wait,
Thy sister came with loose dishevelled hail-3

Nemesis kisses 131166, and thy earlier mate —
They watcht the pyre when all had left it bare.

Departing, Delia falteredf ‘Thou wert true,
The Fates were cheerful 1311611, when I was thine:'

The other,‘ ‘,Say what hast 1311011 here 130 do. φ’
Dying, 116 claspt his failing hand 111 1111116.

Α11, yet, if any part of us remains

Β111 1161116 and shadow, Albius 13 1101 dead3
And 111011, Catullus, in Elysian plains,

With Calvus see the 1vy crown his head.

Thou, Gallus, prodigal of life and blood,
If false the charge of amity betrayed,

And aught remains across the Stygian flood,
Shalt meet him yonder with thy happy shade.

Refined Tibullus! thou art joined to those
Living m calm communion with the blest3

In peaceful urn thy quiet bones repose -
May earth lie lightly where thy ashes rest!
