286 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

THE SUN-GOD'S PALACE.

‘⁴ Tun Mnuuonrnosrzs. '’

Sumam on lofty columns, bright with gold
And fiery carbuncle, its roof inlaid

With ivory‚ rose the Palace of the Suu,
Approacht by folding gates witzh silver sheen

- Radiant3 material priceless,-—ye1: less prized
For its own worth than what the cunning head
Of Mulciber thereon had wrought‚—the globe

Of Earth‚ ——the Seas that wash it round, —the Skies ⁸

That overhang it. Mid the waters played
Their Gods caerulean. Triton with his horn
Was there, and Proteus of 'the shifting shape,
And old AEgeon, curbing with firm hand

The monsters of the deep. Her Nereids there
Round Doris sported, seeming, some to swim‚
Some on the rocks their tresses green to dry,
Some dolphin·borne to ride3 nor all in face
The same, nor different ; —so should sisters be.
Earth showed her men and towns and woods and beasts
And streame and nymphs and rural deibies:

⁴ And over all the mimic Heaven was bright
With the twelve Zodiac signs, on either valve
Of the great portal figured, — six on each.

IMPERTINENCE PUNISHED.

‘⁴ Tun METAMORPHOSES.''

WEARY a'nd travel-worn, - her lips unwet

With water, at a straw-thatcht cottage door

The Wanderer knockt. An ancient crone came forth
And saw her need, and hospitable brought

Her bowl of barley-broth, and bade her drink.
Thankful she raised it : —but a graceless boy

And inipudent stood by, and, ere the half

Was drained, “ Ha! ha! 366 how the glutton swills!”
With insolent jeer he cried. The Goddess' ire

Was roused, and, as he spoke‚ what liquor yet
