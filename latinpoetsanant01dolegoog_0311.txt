ORPHEUS IN 'HA DES. 287

The bowl retained full 111 his face she dasht.
His cheeks broke out in blotches : —what were arms
Turned legS, and from the shortened trunk a tail

Tapered behind. Small mischief evermore
Might that small body work : —the lizard's self

ι Was larger now than he. With terror shriekt

The crone, and weeping stoopt her altered child
Το raise ; —the little monster fled her grasp

And wriggled into hiding. Still his name

His nature tells, and, from the star-like spots
That mark him, known as Stellio crawls the N ewt.

—- Translacion os Hamus Kmo.

 

ORPHEUS IN HADES.

So sang he, and, accordant to his plaint,

As wailed the stringS, the bloodless Ghosts were moved
To weeping. By the lips of Tantalus
Unheeded slipt the wave ; —- Ixion's wheel
Forgot to whir13——the Vulture's bloody feast
Was stayed ; —awhile the Belides forbore

Their leaky urns to dip 3 - and Sisyphus .
Sate listening on his stone. Then first, they say,
The iron cheeks of the Eumenides

Were wet with pity. Of the nether realm

Nor King nor Queen had heart to say him nay.
Forth from a host of new-descended Shades
Eurydice was called3 and, halting yet

Slow with her recent wound she came — alive,
On one condition to her spouse restored,

That, till Avernus' vale is past and earth
Regained, he look not backward, or the boon

Is null and forfeit. Through the silent reahn
Upward against the steep and fronting hill
Dark with obscurest gloom, the way he led:
And now the upper air was all but won,

When, fearful lest the toil o'ertask her strength,
And yearning to behold the form he loved‚

An instant back he lookt, — and back the Shade
That instant fied! The arms that wildly strove
