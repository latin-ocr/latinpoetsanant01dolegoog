THE GJA NTs’ WA R.

The gods of greater nations dwell around,
And on the right and 1611 1116 1131306 110111111;
The commons where they can3 the nobler sort,
With winding doors wide open, front the court.
This place, as 131 33 631111 with heaven may vie,
I dare to call the Louvre of the sky.
When all were placed, in seats distinctly known,
And he, their father, had assumed the throne,
Upon 1113 ivory sceptre first he leant,
Then shook 1113 head, that shook 13116 firmament:
Air, earth, and seas obeyed 13116 Almighty nod:
And, with a general 1631, 00111631 1116 god.
At length, with indignation, thus he broke
His awful silence, and the powers bespoke.

“ Ι was not more concerned in that debate
01 empire, when our universal state
Was put 130 hazard, and the giant 1306
0111 captive skies were ready to embrace:
For though the foe was fierce, the seeds 01 311
Rebellion sprung from one origina13
Now wheresoever ambient waters glide,
All are corrupt, and all must be destroyed.
Let me this holy protestation make:
By hell, and hell's inviolable lake,
I tried whatever in the god-head lay3
But gangrened members must be lopt away,
Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay.
There dwells below a race 01 (1613190113,
01 nymphs in waters, and 01 1311113 111 woods3
Who, though not worthy' yet in heaven to live,
Let 'em 31 16331 enjoy that earth we give.
Can these be thought secure] y lodged below,
When I myself, who no superior know,
I, who have heaven and earth at my command,
Have been attempted by Lycaon's hand ⁶? '²
At this a murmur through the synod went,
And with one voice they vote his punishment.
Thus, when conspiring traitors dared to doom
The fall of Caesar, and, in him, 01 Rome,
The nations trembled with a pious 1631,
All anxious for their earthly thunderer3
Nor was their care, 0 Caesar, less esteemed

By thee, than that 01 heaven 101 Jove was deemed;
