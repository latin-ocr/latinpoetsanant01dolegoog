290 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain
Their murmurs‚ then resumed his speech again.
The gods to silence were composed, and sate
With reverence due to his superior state.

“ Cancel your pious cares; already he
Has paid 1118 debt to justice, and to me.
Yet what his 01111168, and what my judgments were,
Remains for me thus briefly to declare.
The clamours of this vile degenerate age, ·
The cries 01 0111116118, and the oppressor's rago,
Had reacht the stars3 Ι will descend, said Ι,
111 hope to prove this loud complaint 6 116.
Disguised in human shape‚ Ι travelled round
The world, and more than what Ι heard, Ι found.
O'er Maenalus I took my steepy way,
By caverns infamous for beasts of prey.
Then crost Cyllene, and 1116 piny shade,
More infamous by 011181 Lycaon made:
Dark night had covered heaven and earth, before
I entered his unhospitable door.
Just at my entrance, I displayed the sign
That somewhat was approaching 01 divine.
The prostrate people pray3 the tyrant grins3
And, adding profanation to his sins,
‘ Ι ’11 try,' said he, ‘ and if 6 god appear,
To prove his deity shall cost him dear.'
’T was late; the graceless wretch my death prepareS,
When Ι should soundly sleep, opprest with cares:
This dire experiment he chose, 10 prove
If Ι were 11101161, 01 undoubted Jove:
But first he had resolved 10 1681 my power:
Not long before, but in a luckless hour,
Some legates sent from the Molossian state,
W ere on 6 1166061111 errand come 10 116611
01 these he murders one, he boils the fiesh,
And lays the mangled morsels 111 6 dish:
Some parts he roasts; 111611 serves it up so drest‚
And bids 1116 welcome to this human feast.
Moved with disdain, the table Ι o'erturned,
And with avenging flames the palace burned.
The tyrant‚ in a fright, 101 81161161 861118
The neighbouring fields, and scours along the plains.
Howling he fied, and fain he would have spoke,
