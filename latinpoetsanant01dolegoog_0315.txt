THE GIANTS' WAR.

But human voice 1113 111-11131 10113113 10130011,
About his lips the gathered 103111 113 011111113,

And breathing slaughter, still with rage he 11111113,

But on the bleating flock his fury turns.

His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs

Cleaves to his back3 a famisht 1303 113 113313 3

His arms descend, his shoulders sink away,

Το multiply his legs 101 011333 01 prey.

He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains,

And the same rage in other members 1313113,

Η13 eyes still sparkle in a narrower space,

His jaws retain the grin, and violence 01 1113 1303.
“ Τ1113 1133 3 single ruin, but not one.

Deserves 30 ]’1131 3 punishment alone.

Mankind 's 3 1110113131, and the ungodly 1111133,

Confederate into guilt, are sworn to crimes.

All 313 alike involved in ill, 31111 311

Μ1131 by the same relentless fury 1311.”
Thus ended he3 the greater gods assent,

By clamours urging his severe intent;

The less fill up the cry for punishment.

Yet 31111 111111 pity they remember man3

· And mourn 33 much 33 heavenly spirits can.

They ask, when 111033 were 1031 01 1111111311 birth,

What he would do with all his waste 01 331111 ?

If his dispeopled world he would resign

To 1133313, 3 1111113, and more ignoble line ?

Neglected altars must no longer smoke‚

If none were left to worship and invoke.

To whom the father 01 1113 gods replied:

“ Lay that unnecessary 1331· aside ε

Μ1113 113 1113 0313 new people to provide.

I will from wondrous principles ordain

A 1303 unlike the first, and try my skill ag‘ain.⁹'
Already had he 1031 1113 flaming brand,

And rolled the thunder 111 1113 3113010113 hand ;

Preparing to discharge on 3333 31111 land:

But stopt for sear, thus violently driven, .

The sparks should catch his axletree 01 heaven.

Remembering, in the FateS, a time, when fire

Should to the battlements 01 heaven aspire,

And all his blazing worlds above should burn,
And all the inferior globe to einum-s tam-n,
