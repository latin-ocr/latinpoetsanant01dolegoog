292 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

His dire artillery thus dismist, he 116111
Η18 thought to some securer punishment: .
Concludes 10 pour a watery deluge down3
And what he durst 11013 burn, resolves 130 drown.

The Northern breath, that freezes floods, he binds 3
With all 1116 race of cloud-dispelling winds:
The South he 10081, who night and horror brings3 -
And fogs are shaken from his flaggy wings.
From his divided beard two 8131661118 116 pours; “
His head and rheumy eyes distil in showers.
With rain his robe and heavy mantle flow :
And lazy 1111818 are lowering on his brow,
Stin as he swept along, with his 6161161113 fist,
He squeezed 1116 clouds3 1116 imprisoned clouds resist:
The skieS, from pole 10 pole, with peals resound ;
And showers enlarged come pouring on the ground.
Then clad in colours of a various dye,
‹Iunonian Iris breeds a new supply .
To feed 1116 clouds: impetuous rain descends;
The bearded corn 1161166111 1116 burden bends:
Defrauded clowns deplore their perisht grain3
And 1116 long labours of the year are vain.

Nor from his patrimonia] heaven alone
Is Jove content 10 pour his vengeance down:
Aid from his brother of the sea he craveS,
To help him with auxiliary waveS.
The watery tyrant calls his brooks and floods',
Who roll from mossy caves, their 11101813 abodes;
And with perpetual urus his palace fill; “
To whom, in brief, he 111118 imparts his will.

“ Small exhortationi needs; your powers employ;
And 11118 bad world (so Jove requires) destroy.
Letz loose 1116 161118 10 611 your watery store:
Bear down 1116 (161118, and open every door.''

The floods by nature enemies 10 land,
And proudly swelling with their new command,
Remove 1116 living 8101168 11161 8101113 111611· way,
And, gushing from their source, augment 13116 866.
Τ11611, with his mace, 111611· monarch struck the ground:
With inward trembling earth received 1116 wound 3
And rising streams a ready passage found.
The expanded waters gather on 1116 plain,

They fioat 1116 fialas, and overtop 13116 grain 3
