THE GIANTS' WAR. 293

Then rushing onwards with a sweepy sway‚

Bear flooks‚ and folds, and labouring hinds away.
Nor safe their dwellings were3 for, sapt by floodS,
Their houses fell upon their household godS.

' The solid pileS, too strongly built to fall,

High o'er their heads behold a watery wall.
Now seas and earth were in confusion lost ;
A world of waterS‚ and without a coast.

One olimbs a oliff3 one in his boat is borne,
And ploughs above, where late he sowed his corn.
Others o'er ohimney-tops and turrets row,

And drop their anchors on the meads below;

Or downward driven, they bruise the tender vine,
Or tost alost, are knookt against a pine.

And where of late the kids had oropt the graSS‚
The monsters of the deep now take their place.
Insulting Nereids on the cities ride,

And wondering dolphins o'er the palaoe glide.

On leaveS‚ and masts of mighty oaks they browse,
And their broad fins entagle in the boughS.

The frighted wolf now swims among the sheep3
The yellow lion wanders in the deep:

His rapid force no longer helps the boar:

The stag swims faster than he ran before.

The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain,
Despair of land, and drop into the main.

Now hills and vales no more distinction know
And levelled nature lies opprest below.

The most of mortals perish in the flood,

The smallsemainder dies for want of food.

A mountain of stupendous height there stands
Betwixt the Athenian and Boeotian landS‚

The bound of fruitful fields‚ while fields they were,
But then a field of waters did appear:

Parnassus is its name: whose forky rise

'Mounts through the clouds, and mates the lofty skies
High on the summit of this dubious eliff,
Deucalion wasting, moored his little skiff.

He with his wife were only left behind

Of perisht man3 they two were human kind.

The mountain-nymphs and Themis they adore,

· And from her oracles relies implore. ·

The most upright of morta] man was he;
