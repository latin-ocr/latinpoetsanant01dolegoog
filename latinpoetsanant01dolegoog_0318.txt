294 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

The most sincere and 1101)7 woman, she.
When Jupiter, surveying earth 'from high,
Beheld it in a lake of water lie,
That, where so many milliens lately lived,
But two, the best of either sex, survived,
He 10081 1119 northern wind3 fi’erce Boreas flies
Το puff away the 01011118, and purge the skies:
Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driven
Discover heaven to earth, and earth to heaven. -
The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace
On the rough sea, and smooths its furrowed face. ·
Already Triton, at his call, appears
Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears ,
And in 1118 1131111 3 crooked trumpet bears,
The sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire,
And give the waves the signal to retire.
His writhen shell he takeS, whose narrow vent
Grows by degrees into a large extent3
Then gives it breath3 the blast, with doubling sound,
Runs the wide circuit of the world around.
The sun first heard it, in his early East,
And met 1119 rattling echoes in the West.
The waters‚ listening to the trumpet's 1·,oar
Obey the summons, and forsake the shore.
Ay thin c11cu1nfe1ence of land appears;
And Earth, but 1101 31 once, her visage 19318,
Α1111 peeps upon the 8938 from upper grounds.
The 811931118, 11111 just contained within their boundS‚
By slow degrees into theirchannels crawl 3
And earth increases as the water-s fall.
In longer time the tops of trees appear,
Which mud on their dishonoured branches bear.
At length the world was all restored to view,
But desolate, and of a sickly hue:
Nature beheld herself and stood aghast,
A dismal desert, and a silent waste.
Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look,
Beheld‚ he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke:
“ Oh wife, oh sister, oh of all thy kind
The best and only creature left behind,
By kindred, love, 31111 now by dangers joined3
Of multitudeS, who breathed the common air,
We two remain3 a species in a pail-3
