THE GIANTS’ WAR. 295

The rest the seas have swallowed3 nor have we
E'en of this wretched life a certainty.

The clouds are still above3 and, while Ι speak,
A second deluge o'er our heads may break.
Should I be snatcht from hence and thou remain,
without relief, or partner of thy pain,

How could'st thou such a wretched life sustain ’.Ρ
Should I be left, and thou be lost, the sea,

That buried her I loved‚ should bury me.

Oh, could our father his old arts inspire,

And make me heir of his informing fire,

That so I might abolisht 'man retrieve‚

And perisht people in new souls might live!

But Heaven is pleased‚ nor ought we to com plain,
That we, the examples of mankind remain.''

He said: the careful couple join their tearS,
And then invoke the gods, with pious prayers.
Thus in devotion having eased their grief,

From sacred oracles they seek relief:

And to Cephisus' brook their way pursue:

The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew.

With living waters in the fountain bred,

They sprinkle first their garments, and their head,

Then took the way which to the temple led.

The roofs were all defiled with moss and mire,

The desert altars void of solemn fire.

Before the gradual prostrate they adored‚ ”

The pavement kist3 and thus the saint implored.

“ O righteous Themis, if the powers above

By prayers are bent to pity, and to love 3

If human miser'ies can move their mind3

If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind3

Tell how we may restore, by second birth,

Mankind, and people desolated earth.

Then thus the gracious goddess, nodding‚ said:

“ Depart, and with your vestments veil your head:

And stooping lowly down, with loosened zoueS‚

Throw each behind your backs your ,mighty mother's
boues?

Amazed'the pair, and mute with wonder, stand,

Till Pyrrha first refused the dire command.

“Forbid it Heaven‚’' said she, “ that I should tear

Those holy relics from the sepulchre.''
