296 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

They pondered the' mysterious words again,

For some new sense: and long they sought in vain.
At length Deucalion cleared his cloudy brow,

And said: “ The dai-k enigma will allow

A meaning, which, if well Ι understand,

From sacrilege will free the god's command:

This earth our mighty mother is, the stones

In her capacious body are her bones:

These we must cast behind.'' With hope, and fear,
‚The woman did the new solution hear:

The man diffides in his own augur-y,

And doubts the gods; yet both resolve to try.
Decending from the mount, they first unbind

Their vests, and, veiled, they cast the stones behind:
The stones (a miracle to moi-tal view,

But long tradition makes it ass for true)
Did first the rigour of their {ind expel,
And suppled into softness as they fell ; ⁴
Then swelled‚ and, swelling‚ by degrees grew warin:
And took the rudiments of human forin3
Imperfect shapeS, in marble such are seen;
When the rude chisel does the man begin3
While yet the roughness of the stone remains,
Withont the rising muscleS, and the veins.

. The sappy parts, and next resembling juice,
Were turned to moisture, for the body's use:
Supplying humourS, blood, and nourishment:
The rest, too solid to receive a bent‚

Converts to bones; and what was once a vein,
Its former name and nature did retain. ἱ

By help of power Divine, in little space,
What the man threw assumed a manly face3
And what the wife, renewed the female race, ,
Hence we derive our nature, born to bear,
Laborious life, and hardened into care.

The rest of animals from teeming earth,
Produced in various forms, received their birth.
The native moisture, in its close retreat,
Digested by the sun's ethereal heat,

As in a kindly womb, began to breed:

Then swelled‚ and quickened by the vital seed,
And some in leSS, and some in longer space,
Were ripened into form, and took a several face.
