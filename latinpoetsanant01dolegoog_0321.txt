-THE GJANTS’ WAR. 297

Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fied,
And seeks‚ with ebbing tideS, his ancient bed,

The fat manure with heavenly fire is warmed,

And crusted creatures‚ as in wombS‚ are formed:
These, when they turn the glebe‚ the peasants find:
Some rude, and yet unfinisht in their kind:

Short of their limbS, a lame imperfect birth;

One half alive, and one of lifeless earth.

For heat and moisture, when in bodies joined,
The temper that results from either kind,
Conception makes 3 and fighting, till they mix,
Their mingled atonis in each other fix.

Thus Nature’s hand the genial bed prepares
With friendly discord‚ and with fruitful ware.

'From hence the surface of the ground with mud
And slime besmeared (the faeces of the flood)
Received the rays of heaven3 and sucking m
The seeds of heat, new creatures did begin:

Some were of several sorts produced before3

But of new monsters earth created more.
Unwillingly, but yet she brought to light

Thee, Python, too, the wondeiing world to fright,
And the new nations‚ with so dire a sight.

So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space

Did his vast body and long train embrace:
Whom Phoebus basking on a bank espied3

Ere now the god his arrows had not tried

But on the trembling decr, or mountain-goat3

At this new quarry he prepares to shoot‚

Though every shaft took place, he spent the store
Of his full quiver3 and 't was long before

The expiring serpent wallowed in his gore.

Then to preserve the fame of such a deed‚

For Python slain‚ he Pythian games decreed‚
WVhere noble youths for mastership should stt-ive,
To quoit‚ to run, and steeds and chariots drive.
The prize was fame, in witness of renown,

An oaken garland did the victor crown.

The laurel was not yet for triumphs borne,

But every green alike by Phoebus worn

Did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing looks adorn.
