298 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

,THE TRANSFORMATION OF DAPHNE INTO A
LAUREL.

Tm: first and fair-est 01 1113 loves was she,
Whom not blind fortune, but the dire decree
Of angry Cupid forced him to des'ire:
Daphne her name, and Peneus was her sire.
Swelled with the pride that new success attendS‚
He sees the stripling, while his bow he bendS‚
And thus insults him : “ Thou lasciviens boy,
Are arms like these for children to employ ἱ)
Know, such achievements are my proper claim:
Due to my vigour and nnerring aim:
Resistless are my shaftS, and Python late,
In such a feathered death, has found 1113 fate.

“ Phoebus, thy shafts are sure on all beside3
But mine on Phoebus: mine the fame shall be

One to .repel desire, and one to cause.
One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold,
To bribe the love, and make the lover bold3
. One blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay
Provokes disdain, and drives desire away.
The blunted bolt against the nymph he drest‚
But with the sharp transfixt Apollo's breast.
The enamonred deity pursues the chase3
The 3001111111 (13111331 31111113 1113 loathed embrace 3
In hnnting beasts of prey her youth employs3
And Phoebe rivals in her rural joys.
With naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare,
And with a fillet binds her flowing hair.
By many snitors sought, she mocks their painS,
And still her vowed virginity maintains.
Impatient 01 3 yoke, the name 01 bride
She 31111113, and hates the joys she never tried.
On wilds and wood she fixes her desire:
