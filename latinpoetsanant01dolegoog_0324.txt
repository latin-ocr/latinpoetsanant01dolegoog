300 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Abate thy speed, and Ι will bate of mine.

Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly3
Nor basely born, nor shepherd's swain am I.
Perhaps thou know'st not my superior state3
And from that ignorance proceeds thy hate.

Me Claros, Delphos, Tenedos obey3

These hands the Patareian sceptre sway.

The king of gods begot me: what shall be,

Or is, or ever waS, ,in fate, Ι 866.

Mine is the invention of the charming lyre3
Sweet notes, and heavenly numbers I inspire.
Sure is my bow, unerring is my dart3

But, ah, 111016 deadly his, who pierced my heart!
Medicine is mine3 what herbs and simples grow
In fields and forestS, all their powers I know3
And am the great physician called below.

Alas, that fields and forests can affor-d

No remedies to 11631 111611 love-sick lord!

To cure the pains of love, no plant avails3

And his own physic the physician fails.''

She heard not half, so furiously she flieS,
And on her ear 1116 imperfect accent dies.

Fear gave her wings: and as 8116 fied, the wind
Increasing spread her flowing hair behind3
And left her legs and thighs exposed 10 view3
Which made the god more eager to pursue.
The god was young, and was 100 1101151 bent

To lose his time in empty compliment:

But led by love, and fired by such a sight,
Impetuously pursued his near delight.

As when the impatient greyhound‚ slipt from far,
Bounds o’er the glebe, to course the fearful hare,
She in her speed does all her safety lay3
And he with double speed pursues the prey;
O’erruns her at the fitting turn, and licks
His chaps in vain, and blows upon the flix: ι
She 'scapeS, and for the neighbouring covert striveS‚
And gaining shelter, doubts if yet she lives:

If little things with great we may compare,
Such was the god, aud such the flying fair:
She, urged by fear, her feet did swiftly move,
But he more swiftly, who was urged by love.
He gathers ground upon her in the 611386 3
