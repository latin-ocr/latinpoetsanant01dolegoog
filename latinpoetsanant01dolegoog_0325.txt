TRANSFORMATION OF DAPHNE. 301

Now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace:
And just is fastening on the wisht embrace.
The nymph grew pale, andin a mortal ssight,
Spent with the labour of so long a flight3
And now despairing‚ cast a mournful loo'k
Upon the streams of her 1131-,311131 brook:

“Oh, help,” she criedst ‘in this extremest need,
If water· gods are (13113133 indeed:
Gape‚ Earth, and this unhappy wretch entomb:
Or change my form whence all my sorrows come Σ ”
Scarce had she finished, when her feet she found
Benumbed with cold, and fastened to the ground:
A filmy rind about her body grow8‚
Her hair to leaveS, her arms extend to boughs:
The nymph is all into a laurel gone.
The smoothness of her skin remains alone.
Yet Phoebus loves her still, and casting round
Her bole his armS, some little warmth he found.
The tree still panted in the unfinisht part,
Not wholly vegetive, and heaved her heart.
He fixed his lips upon the trembling rind3
It swerved aside, and his embrace declined.
To whom the god: “Because thou oanst not be
My mistreSS, I espouse thee for my tree:
Be thou the prize of honour and renown3
The deathless poet, and the poem, crown.v
Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn,
And, after poetS, be by victors worn.
Thou shalt returning Caesar's triumph grace3
When pomps shall in a long procession pass:
Wreathed on the post before his palace wait3
And be the sacred guardian of the gate:
Secure from thunder, and unharmed by Jove,
Unfading as the immortal powers above:
And as the locks of Phoebus are unshorn‚
So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn.’'
The grateful tree was pleased wit‘h what he said,
And shook the shady honours of 1131 head.
