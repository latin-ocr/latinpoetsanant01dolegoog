BAUCIS t AND PHILEMON.

HEAvmv's power is infinite: earth, air, and sea,
The manufacture mass, the making power obey :
By proof to clear your doubt3 in Phrygian ground
Two neighbouring trees, with walls encompast round,
Stand on· a moderate rise, with wonder shown,
One a hard oak, a softer linden one:
I saw the place aud them, by Pittheus sent
To Phrygian realms, my grandsire's government.
Not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt
Of cootS, and of the fishing cor-morant:
Here Jove with Hermes came3 but in disguise
Of mortal men concealed their deities:
One laid aside his thunder, one his rod3
And many toilsome steps together trod;
For harbour at a thousand doors they knocked,
Not one of all the thousand but was locked.
At last an hospitable house they found,
An homely shed3 the roof, not far from ground,
Was thatcht with reeds and straw together bound.
, There Baucis and Philemon lived, and there
Had lived long married, and a happy pair: ·
Now old in love; though little was their store,
Inured to want, their poverty they bore,
Nor aimed at wealth‚ professing to be poor.
For master or for servant here to call,
Was all alike, where only two were all.
Command was none, where equal love was paid‚
Or rather both commanded, both obeyed.

From lofty roofs the gods repulst before,
Now stooping, entered through the little door3
The man (their hearty welcome first exprest)
A common settle drew for either guest,
Inviting each his weary limbs to rest.
But ere *they sat, officious Baucis lays
Two cushions stuft with straw, the seat to raise3
Coarse‚ but the best she had3 then takes the load
Of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad
The living coaIS, and, lest they should expire,

With leaves aud barks she feeds her infant fite:
