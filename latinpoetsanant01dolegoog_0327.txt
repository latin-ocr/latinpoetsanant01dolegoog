BA UCIS A Nn PHILEMON. 303

It smokes, and then with trembling breath she blow8,
Till in a cheerful blaze the flames arose.
With brushwood and with chips she strengthens these,
And adds at last the boughs of rotten trees.
The fire thus formed, she sets the kettle on,
(Like burnisht gold the little seether 8116116).
Next took the coleworts which her husband got
From his own ground (a small well-watered spot);
She stript the stalks of all their leaves 3 the best
She culled‚ and then with handy care she drest.
High o'er the hearth a chine of bacon hung3
Good old Philemon seized it with a prong,
And from the sooty raster drew it down,
Then cut a slice, but scaroe enough for one:
Yet a large portion of a little store,
Which for their sakes alone he wisht were more.
This in the pot he plunged without delay,
To tame the flesh, and drain the salt away.
The time between, before the fire they sat,
And shortened the delay by pleasing chat.

A beam there was, on which a beechen pail
Hung by the handle, on a driven nail :
This filled with water, gently warmed, they set
Before their 8116818; 111 11118 they bathed their feet,
And after with clean towels dried their sweat.
This done, the host produced the genial bed,
Sallow the foot, the 116111618, 61111 1116 816611,
Which with no costly coverlet they spread3
But coarse old garments, yet such robes as these
They laid alone, at feastS,·on holidays.
The good old housewife, tuckiug up her gown,
The table sets3 1116 invited gods lie down.
The trivetrtable of a foot was lame,
A blot which prudent Baucis overcame,
Who thrust beneath the limping leg a sherd,
So was the mended board exactly reared ε
Τ11611 1111111611 11 6’61 with newly gathered mint3
A wholesome herb, that breathed a grateful 866111.
Ρ61168 began the feast, where first was seen
The party-coloured olive, black and green;
Autumnal 66111618 next in order served,
In lees of wine well pickled and preserved3
A 86111611 861611 was the third supply,
