304 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Of endive, 1311131133, and succory3

Then curds and cream, the flower of country fare,

And new-laid eggs, which Baucis' busy care

Turned by a gentle fire, and roasted rare.

All these in earthenware were served to board3

And, next in place, 311 earthen pitcher, stored

With liquor of the best the cottage could afford.

This was the table's ornament and pride,

With figures wrought: like pages at his side

Stood beechen bowls3 and these were shining clean,

Varnisht with wax without, and lined within.

By this the boiling kettle had prepared,

And to the table 33111 1113 smoking lard3

On which with eager appetite they dine,

A savoury bit, that sei-ved to relish wine:

The wine itself was suiting to the rest,

Still working in the must, 31111 lately prest.

The second course succeeds like that before3

PlumS, apples, 111113, 31111, of their wintry store,

Dry figs and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set

In canisters, to enlarge the little treat:

All these a milk-white honeycomb 311110111111,

Which in the midst the country banquet crowned.

But the kind hosts their entertainment grace

With 11331151 welcome, 31111 311 open face3

In all they did, you might discern with ease

A willing mind, and a desire to please.
Meantime the beechen bowls went round, and still,

Though often emptied, were observed to fill,

Filled without handS‚ and of their own accord

Rau without feet, and danced about the board.

Devotion seized the pair, to see the feast

With wine, and of no common grape‚ inci-east3

And up they held their 11311113, 31111 fell to prayer,

Excusing, as they could, 111311 country fare.

One goose they had ('t was all they could allow)

A wakeful sentry, and on duty now,

Whom to the gods for sacrifice they vow:

Her, with malicious zeal, the couple viewed3

She ran for life, and, limping, they pursued:

Full well the fowl perceived their bad intent,

And would not make her master's compliment3

But, persecuted‚ to the powers she flios,
