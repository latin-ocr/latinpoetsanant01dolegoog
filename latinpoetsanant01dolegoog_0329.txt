And close between the legs of Jove she lies,
He, with a gracious ear, the suppliant heard,
Andcsaved her life 3 then what he was declared,
And'owned the god. “ The neighbourhood,'' said he,
“ Shall justly perish for impiety:
You stand alone exempted3 but obey
With speed, and follow where we lead the way:
Leave these accurst3 and to the mountain’s height
Ascend3 nor once look backward in your flight.''
They haste, and what their tardy feet denied,
The trusty staff (their better leg) supplied.
An arrow's flight they wanted to the top,
And there secure, but spent with travel, stop3
Then turn their now no more forbidden eyes;
Lost in a lake the floated level lies :
A watery desert covers all the plainS,
Their cot alone, as in an isle remains :
Wondering with peeping eyes, while they deplore
Α Their neighbours' fate, and country now no more,
Their little shed, scarce large enough for two,
Seems, from the ground incr-east, in height and bulk to
grow.
A stately temple shoots within the skies:
The crotchets of their cot in columns rise:
The pavenient polisht marble they behold,
The gates with sculpture graced, thexspires and tiles of
go d
Then thus the sire of godS, with looks serene,
“Speak thy desire, thou only just of men3
And thou, Ο woman, only worthy found
To be with such a man in marriage bound.''
Awhile they whisper3 then, to Jove addrest,
Philemon thus prefers t’heir j0int request:
“ We orave to serve before your sacred shrine,
And offer at your altars rites divine:
And since not any action of our life
Has been polluted with domestic strife,
We beg one hour of death3 that neither she
With widow's tears may live 10 bury me,
Nor weeping I, with withered arms, may bear
My breathless Baucis to the sepulchress?
The godheads sign their suit. They run their race
In the same tenor all the appointed space3
