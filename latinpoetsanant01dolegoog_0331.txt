AESA C U S TRANSFORMED. 307

Fair Alyxotho'e, a country maid,

Bare AEsaous by stealth in Ida's shade.

He fled the noisy town, and pompous court,
Loved the lone hills, and simple rural sport,
And seldom to the city would resort.

Yet he no rustic olownishness profest,

Nor was soft love a stranger to his breast:

The youth had long the nymph Hesperia wooed,
Oft through the thioket, or the mead pursued:
Her haply on her father’s bank he spied,

While fearless she her silver tresses dried3
Away she fied: not stags with half such speed,
Before the prowling wolf, soud o'er the mead3
Not duoks‚ when they the safer flood forsake,
Pursued by hawks, so swift regain the lake.

As fast 116 followed in the hot career3

Desire the lover winged, the virgin fear.

A snake unseen now pieroed her heedless foot3
Quiok through the veins the venomed juioes shoot:
She fell, and 'soaped by death his fieroe pursuit.
Her lifeless body, frightened, he embraced,
And eried, “ Not this I dreaded, but thy haste:
Oh, had my love been 1688, 01 1688 thy 16611
Τ116 victory thus bought is far too dear.
Aoeursed snake! yet I more oursed than he!
He gave the wound3 the cause was given by me,
Yet none shall say, that unrevenged you died.''
He spoke; then elimbed a oliff's o’erhanging side,
And, resolute, leapt on the foaming tide.
Thetys received him gently on the wave3

The death he sought denied, and feathers gave.
Debarred the surest remedy 01 grief,

And forced to live, he ourst the unaskt relief.
Then 011 1118 airy pinions upward flies,

And at a second fall successless tries:

The downy plume a quiok descent denies,
Enraged, he often dives beneath the wave:

And there in vain expects to find a grave,

His eeaseless sorrow 101 the unhappy maid
Meagred his look, and 'on his spirits preyed.
Still near the sounding deep he lives3 his 1161116
From frequent diving and emerging came.
