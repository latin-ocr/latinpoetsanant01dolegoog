308 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

TO MAXIMUS.

Emer 11.

.MAxmth‚ great by name and great by'kind‚

Who gracest thy birth by thy noble mindo,

For when that thou into the world didst come,

As if they meant to give thy birthright roome‚
Three hundred Fabii in one day did fall,

That fatal] day tooke not away them all. ·
Perhaps thou wouldst know from whom this letter sent.
Or else to know whose Ι am thou art bent.

What shall I doe ? When thou my name hast red,
I feare thou wilt unwillingly proceede:

Yet if that any chance these lines to 866,

Ι dare confesse that I writ them to thee,

And that my purpose therein was that I

Might so bewayle my owne sad misery,

And that Ι writ them to thee, I dare confesse,

To signifie to thee my own distresse‚

Who though I doe confesse Ι worthy am

Of more punishment, Ι cannot more sustaine‚
Dangers and enemies on each side come on me,

As if with my Country, safety were took from me3
Who that their wounded enemies may fall,

Doe yson their arrows with the vipers gall.

The orseman arm'd with these' the walls beholds,
Like a Wolfe that walks round about sheepefold3‚
When with a string of horses guts compact

He bends his bow, whose string is seldom slackt.
A showre of Arrowes from their Bows doth flye
And the gate can scarce keepe out the enemie-
The countries barren without leafe or trec,

And Winters joyned unto winters be.

= Five winters Ι have beene in this estate,

Enduring cold, and striving with my fate.

My griefe is in continuall teares exprest‚

And deadly dulnesse doth possesse my brest,
Happie was Niobe, for although that she,

The death of her children‘did behold and see,

Yet being chang’d into a stone thereby

She grew insensible of 1161· misery.
