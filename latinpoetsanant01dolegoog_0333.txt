. OVID'S DECEMBER VOYAGE To EXILE. 309

Happy are you, who weeping for your brother
The Popler with his barke your face did cover,
But Ι cannot be ehang'd to any tree‚

And I doe wish in vaine a stone to be!

— Translated by Wnr Samousum„ (1639).

 

ovrn’s DECEMBER VOYAGE To EXILE.

‘⁶ Tus. Turs'rust‘

AY me, poore wreteh, what watery Mountaines rise!
You 'd think their lofty tops would touch the skies.
Streight lowly vallies stoope (when sea doth sunder)
Yon ’d think their bottomes reacht to hell or under.
WVhere ere I look, there ’s nought but sky and water,
This swels wth waves and that wth stormes doth datter,
The winds betweene them roare with hideous noise‚
And waves demur-re which hath the master-voyee.
For now blows Eurus from the purple East.

Now rises Zephyrus from the setting West.

Now rages Boreas from the Northern Beare.

Now Notus warres with him from Southern spheare.
The Pilot doubtfull what to shun 01· ohuse‚
Ambiguous mischiefes make his Art to muse.

Dead men we are: all hope of safeties gone.

Even whilst I speake the waves orewhelme my mone.
They 'll drowne my soule, and while my mouth doth pray‚
Thereby the deadly water finds a way.

My loving wife, naught save mine exile wayles,

She neither grieves nor knows‘ my other ayles.

She little thinkes Ime tost on vastest maine,

Hurried with winds ; still ready to be slaine.

'T was well I did not suffer her to goe,

Then had Ι borne a double deadly blow.

Now, though I perish, yet (since she is safe)

I shall outlive my death at least one halfe.

VVoes me, what flashing lights from heaven do spring.
What orackes of thunder from the skies doe ring!
And on our shippe the floting billowes falles

Like canon bullets on besieged walles;

anh following wave the former still exceede,

As if it were a tenth of greatest Meede.
