310 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

I feare not death, but yet this kinde is hatefull,

Bate me but shipwraeke, death shall be most gratefull.
Whether on 's fair or o' th' sword one dye,

Some comfort 't is upon firme land to lye,

To make one's will and looke to be interred

And not in fishes bowels- to lye buried.

Yet say such death I merit, why should those
Innocent soules i' th’ shippe my fate inelose ?

— Translation os ZAcmRY Qum (1639).

 

COMPLIANCE.

“Tun Am· οε· Lovn.”

INDULGENCE soon takes with a Noble Mind:
Who ean be harsh that sees another kind ’.Ρ

Most times the greatest Art is to eomply

In granting that whieh J ustiee might deny.

We form our tender Plants by soft DegreeS,

And from a warping Stem raise stately Trees.

To eut th' opposing Waves we strive in vain3
But if we rise with 'em‚ and fall again,

The wish'd-for Land with Ease we may attain.
Such Complaisanee will a rough Humour bend,
And yielding to one Failure save a Friend.
Mildness and 'semper have a Foree Divine

To make ev'n Passion with their Nature join.
The Hawk we hate, as living still in ArmS,

And Wolves assiduous in the Shepherds Harms.
The Sociable Swallow has no Fears:

Upon our Tow'rs the Dove her N est prepareS,
And both of them live free from Human Snares.
Far from lond Rage and eeehoing Noise of Fights
The softest Love in gentle sound delights.
Smooth Mirth, bright Smiles‚ calm Peaee‚ and flowing J oy
Are the Companions of the Paphian Boy.

Such as when Hymen first his Mantle sp read

All o ’er the sacred Down which made the Bridal Bed.
These Blandishments keep Love upon the Wing,
His Presenee fresh and alv‘vays 1n the Spring.
This makes a Prospeet endless to the view,

With Light that rises still, and still ιε new.
