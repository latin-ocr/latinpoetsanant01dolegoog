MUSIC' AND POETRY. 311

At your approach find ev' thing serene,

Like Paphos honour’ d byt e Cypriam, Quem,

Who brings along her Daughter Harmony‚

With Muses sprang from Jove and Graces Three.
Birds shot by you, Fish by your Angle caught,
The Golden Apples from Hesperia brought,

The blushing Peaeh‚ the fragrant NectareenS,

, Laid in fresh Beds of Flowers and Soented GreenS,
Fair Lillies strow'd with bloody MulberrieS,

Or Grapes whose J uiee made Bacchus reaeh the skies,
May oftentimes a. grateful Present make

Not for the Value‚ but the Giver's sake.

— Imitation os W. Kmo (1700).

 

MUSIO AND POETRY.

‘⁴ Tim Am· or· Lovn.'‘

Vmems should not unskill'd in Musiek be3

For what's more like themselves than Harmony!
Let not Viee use it only to betray,

And Sirens by their Songs entiee their Prey.

Let it with Sense‚ with Voiee and Beauty join‚

, Grateful to Eyes and Ear, and to the Mind divine:
For there’s a double Graee when pleasing strings
Are touoh’d by Her that more delightful singS.
Thus Ovpheus did the Rage of Deserts quen,
And eharm'd the monstrous Instruments of Hell.
New Walls to Thebes Amphion thus began,
Whilst to the Work officious Marble ran.

Thus with his Harp and Voiee Arion rode
On the mute Fish safe through the rolling Flood.

Nor are the Essays of the Female Wit

Less charming in the Verses they have writ.
From antient Ages Love has found the way
Its bashful Thoughts by Letters to eonvey3
Which sometimes run in sueh engaging strain,
That Pity makes the Fair write back again.
What' s thus intended some small time delay:
His Passion strengthens rather by your stay.
