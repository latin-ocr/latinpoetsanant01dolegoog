312 PUBLIUS OVIDIUS NASO.

Then with a cautious Wit your Pen withhold,
Lest a too free expression make him bold.
Create a Mixture ’twixt his Hope and Fear‚
And in Reproof let Tenderness appear.

And Niobe the childless danoe.

Whose life is doomed to wilds like these,

Nor the felt sorrow wound my breast ?
Say that I ean —- but foes beset

This place and rob me of all rest.

And fallen far from what it was.

The land though rioh that laeks the plough
Is barren, save of thorns and grass,
