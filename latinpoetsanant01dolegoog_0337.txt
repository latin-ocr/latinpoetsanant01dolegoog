DA NGER oF HA PPINEss. 313

The horse that long halah idle stood,
Is soon o⁷ertaken in the race3

And, torn from its familiar flood,
The ehinky‘pinnaee rots apaee.

Nor hope ‚that Ι, before but mean,-
Can to my former self neturn.

Long sense of ins hath burned my brain3
Half the old fires no longer burn.

Yet oft I take the pen and try,
As now to build the measured rime.
Words come not, or, as meet thine eye,
Words worthy of their place and time.

Last, glory oheers the heart that falls
And love of praise inspires the mind—-

I followed once Fame’s star, my sails
Filled with a favourable wind.

But now 't is not so well with me,

To care if Fame be lost o1· won.
Nay‚ but I would, if that might be,
Live all unknown beneath the sun.

DANGER OF HAPPINESS.

ΤΗΑΤ mind is soonest caught which springs with mirth:
Like corne which riots on the lusty earth.
The heart, that 's free from sorrow, open lies
To 'Venus arte, and flattering Ioues surprise.
Sad Ilium repell'd the Graecz’an force:
But full of ioy, reeeau'd the fatall horse.
