MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS.

MARTIAL, the epigrammatist, was born at Bilbilis, in
Spain, in the year 43 ΑΛ). He proceeded to Rome in the
thirteenth year of N ero’s reign. For thirty-five years he
lived in the capital, succeeding apparently by means of
his wits and his cleverness in flattery in acquiring a hand·
some mansion in the city and a villa near Nomentum.
The emperors Titus and Domitian granted him their fa-
vour. His poemS, which were marked by keen wit, though
twenty per cent of them are extremely gross and licen-
tious, were popular all over the Roman world. He thus
acquired the rank of tribune and the rights of the eques·
trian order, and though he was childless he was granted the
privileges of one who had three children. In 100 he re·
turned to Bilbilis and lived on the estate of his wife, Mar-
cella. The date of his death is not known. His extant
works consist of about fifteen hundred “ Epigrams ’'
divided into fourteen books. He was the first to restrict
the term epiqram, which was originally an inscription, to
a short poem ending in a sharp point. The value of his
work consists largely in the light which his verses throw
on the manner and customs of the Romans in the first
century after Christ. They abound also in interesting
historica] allusions. The “ Liber de Spectaculis '’ relates
to the shows given by Titus and Domitian. The first
nine books were written in Rome — except the third,
which was composed during a tour in northern Italy.
, The tenth, which was twice published, celebrates Trajan’s
arrival in Rome. Theeleventh marks Martial's last year
in Italy. The twelfth was probably composed after his
return to Spain. The last two, entitled “ Xenia and
Apophoreta '' contain three hundred and fifty distichS,
describing a variety of small objects such as were given
to friends during the Saturnalia, corresponding to Christ-
mas presents in our day. Of his own works he made
