an lectures Attalus rehearse83

Pleads finely 3 writes fine tales and verses;
Fine epigrams, fine 'faroes vie

With grammar and astrology3

He finely sings and danoes fine1y3

Plays tennis; fiddles most divinely;

All finely done — and nothing well:

Then, if a man the truth may tell,

This all-accomplisht Punehinello

Is a most busy, idle fellow.

A HAPPY LIFE.

WHA'r makes the happiest life below

A few plain 111103, my friend, will show.
A good estate, not earned with toil,

But left by will or given by Fate3

A land of no ungrateful soil;

A 0011313111 fire within your grate3

No law3 few oares; a quiet mind3
Strength unimpared3 a healthful frame3
Wisdom with innoeenoe combined3
Friends, equal both in years and fame 3
Your living easy, and your board

With food, but not with luxury stored3
A bed, though 0113310, 1101 solitary3
Sound sleep to shorten night's dull reign3
Wish nothing that 13 yours to vary ;
Think all enjoyments that remain:

And, for the inevitable honr,

Nor hope it night, nor dread its power.
