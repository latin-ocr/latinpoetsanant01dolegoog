316 MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS.

, ΤΟ A For.

'rums tell me, Cotilus, that you 're a beau:
What this is, Cotilus, 1 wish to know.

“ A beau is one wh0‚ with the nioest care,

In parted looks divides 1113 cui-ling hair3

One who with balm and cinnamon smells sweet;
Whose humming lips some Spanish air repeat3,
Whose naked arms are smoothed with pumice-stone,
And tost about with graces all his own:

A beau is one who takes his constant seat,
From morn till evening, where the ladies meet 3
Andever, on some sofa hovering near,
Whispers some nothing in some fair-one’s ear 3
Who scribbles thousand billets-doux aday3
Still reads and scribbles; seals and sends away.
A beau is one who shrinks, if nearly ptest

By the coarse gai-ment of a neighbour guest3
Who knows who flirts with whom, and still is found
At each good table in successive round3

A beau is one — none better knows than he

A racc-horse and his noble pedigree—'’

Indeed ἱ) - why, Cotilus, if this be 80,

What teasing, trifling thing is called a beau.

EVIL TIMES.

‘⁴ On TIMEs! O manners 1 '' Tully cried of old3
When Catiline in impious plots grew bold:

When in fell arms the son and father stood,

And the sad earth reekt red with civil blood:

Why now — why now “O times! O manners Ξ ” cry?
What 13 it now that shocks thy purity ⁸?

'No sword now maddens‚ and no chiefs destroy,

But all is peace, security, and joy:

These timeS, these manners, that so vile are grown,
Prithee, Caecilian‚ are they not thino own ἱ)
