LIKENESS AND UNLIKENESS.

Yns, I am poor, Callistratus! I own3

And so was ever3 yet not quite unknown,

Graced with a knight's degree ; nor this alone:
But through the world my verse is frequent sung3
And “ That is he! '⁷ sounds buzzed from every tongue:
And what to few, when dust, the Fates assign,

In bloom and freshness of my days is mine.

Thy ceilings on a hundred columns rest3

Wealth, as of upstart freeman, bursts thy chest3
Nile flows in fatness o’er thy ample fields 3
Cisalpine Gaul thy silky fleeces yields:

Lo! such thou art, and such am I: like me,
Callistratus! thou canst not hope to be: ·

A hundred of the crowd resemble thee!

SHOPPING IN ANCIENT DAYS.

MAMURRA many hours does vagrani: tell

I' th' shopS‚ where Rome her richest wares does sell.

Beholds fair slaveS‚ devours them with his eyes—

Not those of common note one first espieS,

‘But which in inner roorns they closely mew,

Removed from mine and from the people’s view.

Glutted with these, choice tables he uncaseS‚

Others of ivory‚ set high, displaceS.

Rich tortoise beds he measures four times o’er‚

Sighs they fit not, and leaves them on that score.
Consults the statues of Corinthian brass

’ By the scent3 and not without blame lets pass

Thy pieceS, Polyclet. He next complains

Of crystals mixt with glaSS‚ and them disdains.

Marks porcelain cupS, sets ten of them apart3

Weighs antique plate (of Mentor's noble art

If any be); connts, i’ the enamelled gold,

The gems that stand. Rich pendants does behold3

For the sardonyx makes a search most nice,

And of the biggest jaspers beats the price.

Tired now at last, after eleven hours' stay,

Two fai-thing pots he buys and bears himself away!
