318 MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS.

FEAR OF DEATH.

Wmm Fannius from his foe did fly,
Himself with his own hands he slew3
Whoe'er a greater madness knew?
Life to destroy for sear to‘die.

 

1HASTA MANANAz

'Po-Mossnow you will live, you always ory3

In what far country does this Mori-ow lie ?

That 't is so mighty long ere it arrive ?

Beyond the Indies does this Mon-ow live ?

’T is so far-fetcht, this Morrow, that Ι sear

’Τ will be both ver)r old and very dear.

To-morrow I will live, the fool doth say3

To-day itself 's too late —the wise lived yesterday!

— Translation os Amanus Cowmr.

 

A CONTRADICTION.

ΙΝ all thy humours, whether grave or mellow,

Thou 'rt such a touchy, testy‚ pleasant fellow3

Hast so much wit and mirth, and spleen about thee,
There is no living with thee οι· without thee!

— Translation os Joun· Anmson.

COMPENSATION.

ΤΗΕ girl that was to ear and sight

More soft of tone, of skin more white
Thau plumaged swans that yield in death
The sweetest murmur of their breath3
