A HINTED WISH. 319

Smooth as Galesus' soft-fleeoed flooks;
Dainty as shells on Lucrine rocks;
Unsullied lilies3 virgin snow ;
Whose looks were tipt with ruddy gold,
Like wool that clothes the Baetio fold3
Like braided hair of girls of Rhine3
As tawny field-mouse sleek and fine;
Whose vermeil mouth breathed Paestum's 108ος
⁴ Or balm fresh honeyoombs disolose3
Or amber yielding odour sweet
From the ohafing hand's soft heat3
By whom the peacook was not fair ;
Nor squirrels pets, nor phoenix rare3
Erotion orumbles in her urn3
Warm from the pile her ashes burn,
Ere yet had closed her sixteenth year
The Fates aecurst have spread her bier3
And with her all I doted on —
My loves, my joys‚ my sportS‚ are gone!
, Yet' Paetus, who like medistrest,
Is fain to beat his mourning breast,
And tear his hair beside a grave,
Asks‚ “ Blush you not to mourn a slave ’.Ρ
I mourn a high, rich, noble wife:
And yet I bear my lot in life 1²²

Thy fortitude exoeeds all bounds ε
Thou hast two hundred thousand pounds;
Thou bear'st— 't is true —thy lot of life:
Thou bear'st the jointure of thy wife l

A HINTED WISH.

YoU told me, Maro, whilst you live
You 'd not a single penny give,

But that, whene'er you ohanot to die,
You 'd leave a handsome legaoy:
You must be mad beyond redreSS,

If my next wish you cannot guess!

— Translation os sinunt Jonusou.
