320 MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS.

HONEST POVERTY.

Yon, sprueely elothed, laugh at my threadbare gown3
’T is threadbare truly, Zoilus, but my own!

— Translation os Wmour.

 

THE· EPIGRAM.

YoU little know what epigram containS,

Who deem it but a jest in jocund strains.

He rather jokeS, who writes what horrid meat
The plagued Thyestes and vext Tereus eat3

Or tells who robed the bey with melting wings ;
Or of the shepherd Polyphemus singS.

Our Muse disdains by fustian to excel,

By rant to rattle or in buskins swell. .
Though turgid themes all men admire, adore,
Be well assured they read my poems more.

 

ΤΟ AN HEIRLESS MISER.

Tnmvns may break looks and with your eash retire,
Your ancient seat may be eonsumed with fire,
Debtors refuse to pay you what they owe,

A barren field destroy the seed you sow;

You may be plundered of the girl you prize,

Your ships may sink with all their merehandise 3
But he who gives— so much from Fate secures —
That is the only wealth forever yours.

 

A ’ PARADOX.

ΗΕ fawns for more though he his thousands own:
- Fortune gives some too much, enough to none.
