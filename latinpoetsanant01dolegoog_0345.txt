THE PoVERTY oF PoETRY. 321

ΤΟ A MAN WHO HAD BURIED HIS SEVENTH
WIFE.

SEVEN wives ἱ and in one grave! There is not found
On the whole globe a richer spot of ground!

 

ΟΝ A QUARRELLING COUPLE.

WHEN you so well agree in life,
The vilest husband, vilest wife,
'T is strange that you should live in strife.

 

A CREDIT COAT.

GAY Bassus for ten thousand bought
A Tyrian robe of rich array,

And was a gainer. How ? Be taught —-
The prudent Bassus did not pay!

 

THE POVERTY OF POETRY.

THoUGH midst the noblest poets thou hast place,
FlaccuS, the offspring of Antenor's raee3
Renounoe the Muses' songs and charming ohoir,
For none of them enrioh though they inspire.
Court not Apollo; Pallas has the gold,

She 's wise and does the gods in mortgage hold.
What profit is there in an ivy wreath ’.Ρ

Its fruits the loaden olive sink beneath.

In Helicon there 's naught but springs and bayS‚
The Muses' harps lond-sounding‚ empty praise.
What with Parnassus' strains hast thou to do ?
The Roman forum 's rich and nearer too,

There ohinks the oash‚ but round the poet's ohair
The smaoks of kisses only fill the air. ·
