HYMN ΤΟ BACCHUS.

“ OEnu’usJ’

Tuon who with Ivy deckt thy dangling 113116 ;
We, armd with janlins, to thy Rites repaire.
Bright ornaments of heauen, thy suppliants heare :
To thee their hands thy noble Thebans reare.

O favour 1 hethei· turne ὼγ virgin face:

With thy syderiall lookes disperse and chace
These lowring cloudS, the 11116318 of Erebus,

And 1336 of greedy fate, from ours and vs,

It thee becomes to haue thy 1168868 1)01111(1

With vernall flowres, with Tyrian 1111161· crown ’,d
And 3111 111 Ivy 1116311168. now liberally

Let flow, and now in knots thy tresses 116.

Α8 when, of thy fiel-ce step-dames wroth afraid,
With boi-rowed shape so effeminately drest,
With robes that sweepe the earth, and naked brest ?
Those Easterne nations who on Ganyes drinke,
And breake the ice on cold Araaecs brinke,

Could. not thy Lyons for thy robe behold,
Drawne in a Chai-iot rooft with vines of gold.
Thee old Silenus on a long-ear'd jado

Attends; vine leaues his rugged fore-head shade.
Lascivious Priests thy Orges celebrate ε

Troopes of Bassai-ian frowes vpon thee wait.
Now on Edonian Panqaeus tread3

Now on the leracian Pindus lofty head,
Distracted liseria-3, ioyn'd with Theban wiues,

To serue th' Oyyyian Iacchus striues;

Whose loynes a Panthers sacred skin invests:
With ruffled haire the matrons hide their brestS, '
And brandish leavy jaulins lightly borne.
Vnhappy Pentheus, now in peeces torne,
Relenting ThyadeS, 111611 fury gon,

Behold with griefe3 nor think that fact their owne.
Fair Ino, with the blew Nereides,

(Thy Aunt o Bacchus) 13131168 in sacred seas:
The stranger Boy there makes his blest aboad,

Of Bacchus race, Palemon, no 811131 God,

Thee, louely Boy, the Thuscan rovers seiz '·d .
