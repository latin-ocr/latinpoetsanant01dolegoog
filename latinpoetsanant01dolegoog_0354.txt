330 LUCIUS ANNAEUS SENECA.

Then Nereus the tumid maine appeas'd,

Blew seas converting into flowry meads:

The Plane-tree there his broad-leau’d branohes spreads;

Greene Laurel groues‚ belou'd by Phoebus, spring,

And ohanting birds among the branehes sing:

About the mast the youthful Ivy twineS‚

The lofty toe imbrae'd with clustered vines ε

Now in the Prow Idaean Lyons rore,

The trembling Poope Ganyetio Tygres bore:

In sea’s themselues th' affrighted sailers threw3

Who turned to Delphina flying ships pursew.

Pactolus wealthy streames thy burden tride,

Whose waters through a golden ohannel glide.

Messa-qiam, quaffing blood and milke‚ vnbend

Their bowes3 nor more with Gertick shafts eontend.

Thy power ax-arm'd Lycuryus kingdome knoweS‚

The fieree Zedacians ‚· and where Boreas blowes

On hoary fields3 those elimates who shake

With oold, that boi-der on Meotis Lake3

And those whose Zem'th is the Arcadia-n starre;

The N orthern WagonS, an'd slow Wagonar.

Soattred Geloni he subdued: disarm’d

The braue Viraqo's; Thermoedonians warm'd

Cold earth with their soft lips 3 but pacifi'd,

Their moone-like shields and quivers laid aside.

Saored Gythoeron he imbrew'd with blood

Of slaine Ophicms. To the shadie wood,

And fields, transformed Proetus daughters runne.

The pleased stepdame now affeots her sonne.

Narro-3, begirt with the AEqean walle,

A bridal bed to Ariadne gaue 3

Her losse repaired with a better friend:

Torrents of wine from barren rocks deseend3

A flood of milke from siluer fountaines powreS,

With Lesbae‘an hony mixt, perfum'd with flowreS,

Which through the medowes murmuring streames pro—
duoe, ,

Whose thirstie banks suokt in the pleasant juce.

The starry Bride to high-areht heauen is led:

Phoebus, his haire vpon his shoulders spred,

Epithalamiums sang that happy night:

Both Cupide now the nuptial tapers light:

Ioue laid his wrathfull thunder-bolts aside,
