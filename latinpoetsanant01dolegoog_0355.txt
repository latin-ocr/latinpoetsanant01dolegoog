THE RULE OF FATE. 331

And hates his lightning, when he Bacchus spi'd.
While radiant stari-es shall runne their vsuall racc,
While Neptune-3 armes the fruitfull earth imbrace,
While Cynthia shall her hornes together close, ’
While Lucifer the rosie Morne fore-showes,

While Lofty Arctos shunnes the salt Profound,
We Bacchus praise and beauty will resound.

— Translation os Gnoson SAR-urs (1632).

THE RULE OF FATE.

O wnr shouldst thou that rulst the sky,
And mou'st those Orbs so ordei-ly,

'rh’ affaires of men so much neglect ?
Nor raise the good, nor bad deiect ⁶?
No: Fortune without order guides
What ever mortall man betides:

Her bounty her blind hands disburse
At randonie3 favour-ing the worse.

Dire lust foil’d Chastity profanes 3

And fraud in Courts of Princes raignes.
Popular suffrages elate

Base men, who honour whom they hate.
Sar] vei-tue the perverse reward
Receaues of Truth ε want presseth hard
On chaster mindes ε th' Adulterer high
In vice commands. Vaine modesty.
Deceitfull excellence.

-- Translation os GEORGE Simus (1632).
