ΤΟ SLEEP.

ΑΗ, Sleep! serenest God! what crime is mine,
That Ι, 1116 only youth, at thee repine ⁶?

Now the husht calm and 8111111688 of repose

O’er fold and nest and lair of woodland grows3
The tree-tops curve their boughs in imaged sleep3
From the fierce torrents altered murmure creep;
The wave-ridged ocean falls its sostened roar,

And seas, at rest, recline upon the shore.

Seven times the moon returns; yet pale and weak,
Distemper sits upon my faded cheek:

The emerging stars, from AEtna's mount that 1186
And Venus' fires have re -illumed the skie83

still, past my plaintS, Aur·'01a 8 chariot flew;

Her shaken lash dropt cold the pitying deW.

Can Ι 611(11116. ‘7 Not if to me were given

The eyes of Argue, 8611111161 of heaven:

Those thousand eyes that watch alternate kept,
Nor all o' er all his body wak‘ed or slept.

Ah, 11161 yet now, beneath Night' 8 161131116111113 shade,
Some youth’ 8 twined arms enfold the twining maid;
Willing he wakeS, while midnight hours roll on,
And 8001118 11166, Sleep! and waves thee to be gone.
Come then from 1116111 ! Oh, leave their bed for 1111116 3
I bid thee not with all thy plumes incline

On my bowed lids3 11118 kindest boon 1168661118

The happy crowd that share thy softest dreams ε
Let thy wand’s tip but touch my closing eye,

Or, lightly hovering, skim and pass me by !
