, AN ARMY PERISHING OF THIRST FINDS
WATER„

Fnou “Tun ΤΗΕΒΛιυ.”

swm by dread thirst, the fainting warriors fail
Beneath their blazing shields and twisted mail:
With their ohoked jaws the parching heats begin3
Then, with the strength of sever, rage within.
With hard pulsation beats each labouring heart‚
The blood olings sickly to each vital part,
And. ourdles in their veinS. The orumbling ground
With steam of dusty vapour smokes around.
From the steeds' mouths no foamy droppings flow3
Champing the unmoistened chain, and lolling low
Their bitted tongues, they spurn the guiding rein,
The rider’s voice, and furious soour the plain.
The seouts explore‚ by mandate of the king,
Lyoymnia's lake and Amymone's spring.
Drained by the seorohing heat the banks are dry,
Nor hope is left them from the showery sky3
As if through Afrie's yellow dust they strayed.
And where no clouds Syene's turrets shade
Tin, as deereed by Bacchus, midst the wood‚
Hypsipyle before the wanderers stood,
In beauteous grief3 though at her bosom hung
The nursling infant, from another sprung3
The hapless babe that called Lycurgus sire;
Though rude her loekS, nor eostly her attire‚

, Yet regal graees markt her lofty air
And shone through all the bitterness of care. . . .
The Lemnian queen awhile in modest pride
Bent on the earth her looks aud soft replied: . . .
“ Why linger I to show the wisht-for flood ⁸?
Come, tread my steps aud search the secret wood.
If haply still the Langian brook retains
Its living tides3 when rapid Cancer reignS‚
Or the keen dog-star lightens from on high,
That wave flows on nor feels the seorehing sky.''
Then, lest her eumbered footstepS, as she led,
Retard the ehiefs, who followed on her tread3
Ah! hapless innocent! by Fate beguiled‚
On a soft turf she lays the clinging child,
