AN ARMY FJNDS WA TER. 335

Where pillowing flowers in fragrant tufts arise,

And his soft tears with fondling murmurs dries. . . .
They traek the thiekets, wandering far and wide,
Through the green glooms that arch on every side ε
Outstrip their guide3 or in compacted throng,
Impatient following, pour at 01106 along.

She, in the midst the secret pathway traoed,

Though hastening yet majestis in her haste.

The dell's hoarse echo speaks the river near-3

And pebbly murmur-s strike the thrilling ear.

· First in the van, glad Argus shook on high

The standard-staff3 and “ Water Ξ ” was the cry.
Through rank to rank the flying sound was flung,
And shouts of “ Water !’' burst from every tongue. ·
So while the vessel shoots the Epyrian shoreS,

The helmsman’s voice, amidst the dash of oars,
Proelaims Leucadia’s height, with sunshine crowned, ·
And the shrill rocks with answering shouts rebound.
Impetuous to the stream they rusht along,

Confused and mixt3 the leaders and the throng3
Alike their thirst, alike they oowering olung

To the 0001 bankS, and 0 ’61 the waters hung

Plunged with thei'r cars the bitted 1101 ses flew

And their mailed riders midst the current drew.

The whirling eddy and the slippery rook

Betray their footing m the heedless shook:

The kings too strive3 all forms of reverenee lost3
Borne down by hampering crowds, in whirlpools tost:
The friend, in· watery hollows pluiiging, tries

To raise his head, with unregarded 01163.

Τ116 ohafed waves flash3 the stream slow- lessening sinkS,
And, distant, from its feeding fountain, shrinks3

The glassy waters, that were seen to glide

With greenish clear transparenoy of tide,
Discoloured mantle in their troubled bed3

The orumbling banks with grassy ruin spread

The muddied stream3 yet still their lips they lave
And slake their hot thirst in the slimy wave.

Suoh was the soene, as if the battle raged,

And the set combat in the stream were waged :

As if the warrior press that stemmed the flood

On some fair oity’s conquered turi-ets stood.
