336 PUBLIUS PAPINIUS STATIUS.

THE TRIUMPH OF HIPPOMEDON.

“ Tun THEBAmst’

Tmm thus the King : - “ Whoe'er the quoit can wield,
And farthest send its weight athwart the field,

Let him stand forth his brawny arm to boast 1 ''

Swift at the word, from out the gazing host,

Young Pterelas with strength unequal drew,
Labouring, the disk, and to small distance threw.

The band around admire the mighty maSS‚

A slippery weight, and formed of polisht brass.

The love of honour bade two youths advance‚
Achaians born, to try the glorious chance 3

A third arose, of Acarnania he,

Of Pisa one, and one from Ephyre,

Nor more, for now Nesimachus’ s son, — (He‘ppomedon)
By acclamations roused, came towerihg on.

Another orb upheaved his strong right hand,

Τ11811 thus: — “Ye Argive flower, ye warlike band,
Who trust your arms shall rase the Tyrian towers,
And batter Cadmus' walls with stony showerS‚
Receive a worthier load3 yon puny ball

Let youngsters toss '' —

⁴ He said, and scornful flung the unheeded weight

Aloof3 the champions,'trembling at the sight,

Prevent disgrace‚ the palm despaired resign3

All but two youths the enormous orb decline,

These conscious shame withheld, and pride of noble line.
As bright and huge the spacious circle lay,

With double light it beamed against the day:

So glittering shows the Thracian Godhead's shield,

With such a gleam affrights Pangaea's field,

When blazing 'gainst the sun it shines from far,

And, clasht, rebellows with the din of war.

· Phlegyas th’e long· expected play began,

Summoned his strength and called forth all the man!
All eyes were bent on his experienced hand,

For oft' 1n Pisa⁷ 8 sports, his native land

Admired that arm, oft on Alpheus’ shore

The ponderous brass 1n exercise he bore3

Where flowed the widest stream he took his stand3
Sure flew the disk from his unerring hand,
