THE TRIUMPH OF HIPPOMEDON. 337

Nor stopt till it had cut the farth'er strand.

And now in dust the polisht ball he 1011311,

Τ11311 8133111 113 11318111, elusive of its hold3

Now fitting to his gripe and nervous arm,
Suspends the crowd with expectation warn13

Nor tempts he yet the plain, but hurled upright,
Emits the 111333, 3 prelude of his might;

Firmly he plants each knee, and o'er his head,
Collecting all his 10133 1113 011013 sped;

It towers to 0111 1113 01011113; now through the skies
Sings in its rapid way, and strengthens 33 11 flies;
Anon with slackened rage 0011133 quivering down,
Heavy and huge‚ and cleaves 1113 301111 ground.

So from the astonisht stars, her nightly 113111,
The sun's pale sister, drawn by magio strain,
Deserts precipitant her darkened sphere:

In vain the nations with officious 1331

Their cymbals 1033 and sounding brass explore ;
The AEmonian hag enjoys 1131 dreadful hour

And smiles benignant 011 1113 labouring. power. . .

Third in the labours 01 1113 disk come on,

With sturdy step and slow, Hippomedon3

Artful and 3110118 113 poised the well-known weight
By Phlegyas warned and fired by Mnestheus' fate,
That 10 avoid and this 10 3111111313.

Η13 vigorous arm he tried before he flung,

Braced 311 1113 1131133 31111 every sinew strung3
Then, with 3 tempest whirl, and wary eye,
Pursued his 0331 31111 hurled the orb on high;

The orb on high tenacious of its course,

True 10 the mighty arm that gave it force,

Far overleaps 311 bound and joys 10 333

113 ancient lord 3301113 01 victory.

“ The theatre's green height and woody wall

Tremble ere it precipitates its fa113

The ponderous mass siuks in the cleaving ground,
While vales and woods and echoing 111113 rebound.
As when from AEtna's smoking summit broke

The eyeless Cyclops heaved the craggy rock3
Where Ocean frets beneath the dashing 031,

And parting surges round the vessel roar:

’Τ was there he aimed the meditated 1131111
