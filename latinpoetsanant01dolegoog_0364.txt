DECIMUS J UNIUS J UVEN ALIS.

JUVENAL, the greatest of the Roman saffirists, flourished
toward the' end of the first century after Christ. Like
Horace, he was the son of a freedman3 his home and
possibly his birthp'lace was at Aquinum. In the early
part of his life he supported himself by declaiming.
Having written some elever verses on the actor Paris, he
turned his attention to satirical writing. But in con·
sequence of the freedom of his strictures on the same
Paris, who was a favourite with the court, he was banished
to a remote district of Egypt under cover of an appoint-
ment as commander of a body of troops. There he died
at an advanced age. Very little is known of Juvenal's
life. He was certainly alive seventeen years after the
death of Paris. Fisteen authentic satires of his have
come down to us, These depict in vivid colours the vices
that were rampant in those degenerate days of Rome.
They are marked by a lofty moral indignation and have
been often imitated by modern poets who detected in
their particular ages or surroundings the same kind of
political or social corruption. Juvenal's works contain
many pithy sentences which have become proverbial,
such as “A sound mind in a sound body,'' “ No man ever
became extremely wicked all at once‚” “But who shall
watch the watchers,'' “ All men praise honesty —and let
her freeze,’' “The innocence of youth most deserves our
revel-ence‚'' “ Nobility is the one only virtue,'' “ Probity
is praised —and starves at home.’'

THE EMPTINESS OF AMBITION.

THE spoils of war: a coat of mail, fixt high
On trophied trunk, in emblemed victory3

A dangling beaver from its helmet cleft3

A chariot's shivered bea1n3 a pendant reft
From boarded galley3 and the captive shown
