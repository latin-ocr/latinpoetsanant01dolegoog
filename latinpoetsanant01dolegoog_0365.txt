THE EMPTINESS OF AMBITION. 341

On the triumphal arch in imaged stone3

Behold the sum of grandem· and of 111188.-
Greek, Roman, and Barbariau aim at 11118.

Hence the hot toil and hair-breadth peril came,
For less the thirst of virtue than of fame.

Who clasps mere naked virtue in his arms ⁶?

Strip off the 1111801, 8110 110 1011801 charnis!

Yet has the glory of some few great names
Enwrapt our country in destroying flames:

This thirst of praise and chiselled 111108, 10311

011 8101108 11131 guard the ashes of 1110 dead.

But a wild fig-tree's wayward growth may tear '
The rifted tomb, and shake the stones in air:
Since sepulchres a human fate obey,

And vaults that shrine the dead themselves decay.
Try in 1110 balance Hannibal : adjust

The scales : how many pounds weighs this big hero's dust ἱ)
Τ1118-11118 18 he whom Afric would, in vain,
Coop 'twixt the tepid Nile and Moorish main:
Swart AEthiop tribes his yoke of empire bore,
And towery elephants bowed down before.

Spain crouches 38 1118 1138831, 31 3 bound

He high o'erleaps the Pyrenaeau mound:

Nature with Alps and snows the pass defends;
Through juice-corroded rocks a way he rendS,
And strides on Italy3 yet naught 18 won3

He throws his glauce beyond3 “y 01 naught 18 done· ,
Till 31 Rome' 8 83108 1110 Punic soldier beats.

And plants my standard 111 1101 very streetsss'

Oh! how, 111 painting, would that form enchant.
That blinking hero on an elephant!

What is his end ? 011, Godlike gloryl say—-

He flies in rout3 in exile steals away:

·A great and gazed-at suppliant, lo 1 he takes

His outdoor station, till a monarch wakes,

Nor swords nor stones nor arrows gave the wound,
And crusht the soul that shook the world around3
What mighty means the blood-atonement bring ?
Cannae’s avenger lurks within a ring.

Gol madman, scour the AIPS, in glory's dream3
A tale for boys and a declaimer's theme.

Lol Pella's youth was cabined, cribbed, confined
Within one world too narrow for his mind:
