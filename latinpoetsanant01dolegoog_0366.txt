342 DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS.

Restless he turned m feverous discontenb

As if by Gyara⁷ s rocks or soant Seriphum pent3
But briok- walled Babylon gave ample room;
Content he 8131010111 him 1n a eataeomb:

,Death‚ death alone 1110 oonsoious 1111111 0110818
What dwarfish frame this swelling soul invests!
They 13011 of Athos' mountain sailed with ships3
Those bold historio lies from Greoian lips :

Of ooean bridged across with paving keels,

And hardened waves o'erpast with ohariot-wheels:
We pin our saith 011 rivers deep that shrank
And floods which, at a meal, 13110 Median drank ε

’ And all that marvel· 1110118011118 poet 811188,

That maudlin swan, who bathed 111 wine his wings.
Say how from Salamis this Sultan past,
Who lasht 1110 Eastern and 1110 Western blast3
Stripes which they know 1101 111 1110 AEolian cave·
He who with setters bound 1110 earth· shaking wave,
And, in his meroy only, spared 10 brand ?
What! orouoht a god, like Neptune, 10 1118 hand ⁶?
Then say, how past he baek'? — behold him now
One bark, through bloody waves, with eorse-ehoked
prow:
Suoh is 1110 glorious fame for whieh'we sigh,
And sueh Ambition's curse and penalty.

INGITEMENT ΤΟ SATIRE.

WHEN he, whose razor mowed my youthful face,
Vies with 13110 noblest of patrician race3

When vile Crispinus, from Canopus sprung,
His Tyrian oloak loose o'er his shoulders flung,
Wears a light Summer ring, and, 130 complete
His folly, fans his finger, faint with heat3

Nor *ean a gem of greater weight sustain —
How can I 81101100 Satire's just disdain ’.Ρ

For who exists so void of virtuous rage,

As 1101 10 lash 1110 vioes of 1110 age?

When pleader Matho' s ohair attraots our eyes,
New- built and filled with his enormous size· ,
