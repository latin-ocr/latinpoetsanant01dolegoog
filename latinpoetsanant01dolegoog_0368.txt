344 DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS.

Their mansionS, gardens, and their plate imbost.
ΟΣ who can taste the tranquil bliss of life,

When the sire keeps the son's corrupted wife ¹?
When curst espousals mark the excess of sin,

And vice buds forth upon the callow chin ἱ)
Indignam: wrath shall N ature’s wants supply

And lash to action such a hard as Ι. . . .

Ah! when did Vice a bolder front display ⁸?

When did fell Avarice seize a richer prey ⁴?

When could the gamester more indulge his crime ⁶?
What former era match the present time ἱ)

Now, not the purse alone, but whole estate

Is ventured on the die's uncertain fate3

‘The chest itself‚ the steward in dismay,

Is forced to yield, so desperate is their play.

What more than madness is it on one throw

To hazard all, yet no compassion show

For their poor tattered slave, whom they behold
Spoiled of his cloak and shivering with the cold ‘2
W hen in more pomp were splendid villas known ἱ)
What ancestor would feast himself alone ἱ)

Now the scant offering‚ placed beyond the door,
Which rather serves to mock than feed the. poor,

Is closely watcht—the master fears deceit,

And trembles lest some unaskt wretch should eat.
Known thou art served. The crier bawls aloud ε -
“ Come forth, ye NobleS, from the gaping crowd.
Here, give the Praetor, give the Tribune place! '’
(For these, alas! are callous to disgrace).

But hark! what voice ⁶? A freedmau boldly ories :—
“ Hold there! I 'm first— who shall my right despise ⁰?
Though from Euphrates’ banks, ’t is true, Ι sprung,
Which my hored ears declare if not my tongue,
What signifies the place where I was born ¹?

Five good estates are sure no theme for scorn.

I prize not birth3 no register I keep.

Does not Corvinus tend another's sheep ?

Beyond most freedmen shines my lucky fate.

Mark what I say and let the Tribunes wait l ''

YeS, to his riches, sacred rank, give way, place ;
Nor let once whitened feet incur disgrace.

Wealth has most votaries — wealth is most revered,
Though in her name no temples yet are reared3
