DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS.

May soon grow rich and play the tyrant's part,
Yet let not all that Tagus can unfold

Who seeks the 066611 with his sands 01 30111,
Rob thee 01 1631, through envy of the knave‚
Who lives the great man's pensioner and slave.
But what deceitful race Ι 111031 detest .

Shall be no more a secret in my breast.

Know 111611 1 hate, uncheckt by 1661 01 31161116,
A Grecian city with a Roman name!

Ι 66111101 11661 these fawning 30113 01 Greece.

Nor thence alone our numerous plagues increase:
Corrupt Orontes washes Tiber's shore3

And crooked harps and 11101613, which before
We never knew, now poison all the land,

Where nymphS, unblushing, take their venal stand.
Go, fools, and court 6 1161111611 foreign face!
Regard‚ Quirinus, thy once simple race,

Whose altered persons Grecian raiment decks.
While richest odours issue from their necks.
From islands studding thick 1116 AEgean main,
From Sicyon, Amydos, a numerous 116111

Η111161 direct their course, swarm o'er the land,
And serve 63 drudges, where they soon command.
Crafty and bold they mine their 366161 way3
With polisht periods lead the weak estray.
What shall we name that all-capacious mind
Where various powers 1111116 01 every kind ἱ)
Grammarian, orator, physician, priest,

Dancer, philosopher, is each at least3

With every wayward humour 6611 comply‚

Sink 10 1116 31161163 below or climb 1116 sky.

Nor Moor, Sarmatian, Thracian was he bred3
But 111 the midst 01 Α1116113 reared his head,
Ingenious Daedalus 1 Must Ι submit ?

Shall these before me shine or higher sit,
Clothed in purple, who but lately came

With figs and prunes, to Rome's 61611161 31161116.
Μ1131 116 disgraced, who boast our Roman birth,
Yield to this scum, this 1611136 01 1116 earth ⁶?
Why need Ι 1161111 66611 low insidious art,

,Ε6611 1611111113 111611, by >which they 36111 1116 beart ’.Ρ

Skilful are they to flatter and commend
A dunce's wit, the beauty of 6 friend
