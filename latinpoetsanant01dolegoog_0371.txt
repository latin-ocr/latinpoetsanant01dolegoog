A COUNTRY RETREAT. 347

Deformed3 lank limbs their vicious taste can please‚
And cripples they compare to Hercules3

The harsh voice, screeching like the hen's rough throat,
Seems in their ear a most melodicus note.

Cannot we flatter and deceive mankind ⁶?

True—but the Greeks alone will credit find.

Who can with them in mimic scenes compare ἱ)

The artless seanymph fascinates our eyes

And the true woman shines without disguise.

Nor only these attention will engage ·

As actors: what ’s the whole of Greece ?—A stage!
Laugh — and a louder laugh will they return3
Weep— with affected sympathy they mourn: ’
Should Winter's rigorous blasts complaints provoke.
They sit and shiver in a woollen cloak;

Or, if a sever fire each throbbing vein,

In silk they flutter and of heat complain.

How can we vie with these, who know so well
Preferment’s path, who study to excel?

Are ever ready with the proffered hand

And Passion's struggling impulse can command3
Who trifles magnify with wondrous skill,

And make their patron's credit what they will.

But worst of all and most to be deplored,

They sap each rising virtue where they board2

The wife, the son, the daughter led astray‚

Or show their talents in ε( meaner way 3

Worm every secret from your servant’s breast

And live your slaveS, your terror and your pest. ·

Who would not rather choose the verdant plain ἶ)
Fix his retreat where Liris gently flows

And seek in Latium elegant repose ἶ)

There couldst thou purchase (and not rent as here ’
At greater price a dungeon by the year)

Some decent villa, where the bubbling stream
