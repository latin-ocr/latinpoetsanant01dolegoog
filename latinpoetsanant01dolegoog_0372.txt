348 DECIMUS JUNIUS JUVENALIS.

Refreshes plants and soothes the poet's dream3
There inight'st thou live, despising useless wealth,
Blest with eontentment, innoeenoe and health,
Thy little garden plant with 1110881 0318,
And treat thy numerous friends with rustic fare.
Such in all ranks is human nature known,
We long for something that we 0311 0111 own.
Here must the siok expire for want 01 1881,
Whose bloated stomachs heave with food opprest.
For who in lodgings e'er expects to sleep ?

· The rich alone 0311 3 8318 distance keep.
Here Death his quiver fills. What erowds we meet!
Chariots and horsemen throng each narrow street 3
The elamorous ooaohma-n, cursing dull delay,
Would Drusus wake, or rouse sea-calves to play.
Should business 0311 the wealthy —at their ease,
Seated aloft, they travel as they please3
Can read or write, or 11 they need repose,
Soft slumbers court them when the curtains 01088.
Still they proceed3 but should we press too near,
Dangers assault us both in 110111 and rear.
One sauoy fellow elbows us aside3
The 011311111311’8 pole with vigour is applied3
Η818 1311818 11111188 the head, and' there a sot
Drives 311 before him, brandishing his pot.
Plastered with mud, and squeezed to death,

· .With bleeding 118818, we pant and gasp for ⁹breath.

— Translation os WILLIAM ΗΕΑΤΗ MARsn.

 

LIFE' S REAL GOOD.

THROUGHOUT the lands which wide-extended lie
From Ganges and the golden Eastern sky

To Gades and the west, how few 0311 888

Their real good, from clouds 01 81101 free!

What hope, what 1831, untinged by Passion’s hue,
Through Reason's luoid medium dost thou view?
What unrepented project hast thou framed. ’7

What vow preferred, nor wisht the gift reclaimed?
Too oft the indulgent rulers 01 1118 skies

Aeoept the fatal incense 01 0111 813118,
