LIFE'S REAL GOOD. 349

And, in requital of their picus care„

Have smote whole houses with accepted prayer.
Girded 111 6011116, 01 belted 111 1116 field

We blindly seek the 1111111111, unrevealed!

Η6 1511615 holds senates mute may curse the hour
That saw him rise in all the pride 01 power· ,
And strength itself, involved 111 Milo⁷ 6 1616
May rue the struggle and be wise too late!
More captives still within thy fatal spell

Dost thou, insatiate power 01 gold, compel 1
81110111 at the altars, must 15116 votary pine3
Pause is there none 101 votary 01 1111116,

Though his possessione o⁷er the rest prevail

As o'er the dolphin breed the British whale.
Yet see those gates the cohort closing round.
Το0 11611 101 Nero is Longinus found.

866 Lateranus in his 116116 constrained‚

And midst his marble busts of wealtli arraigned.
And far, 0111 far too rich 101· tyrant's time—
Thy gardeDS, Seneca, were 611 thy crime!

No missioned soldier bursts the hovel door,

Or treads the sordid dwellings 01 15116 poor!²
Takest thou the road beneath the lamp 01 night ?
8111611 111 ize there needs the pouiard 150 invite!
The r'eed 6 11611 shadow darkling 111 1161 1166111

, 811611 to thy startled sense the robber seem,

While he 01 staff and scrip shall chant 1116 lay,
Nor turn one instant from the caitiff's way.

Yet still with ceaseless prayer the 161166 resound
That, come what will, possessions may abound3
That the kind gods may still enlarge our landS,
And* bags grow wider in our banker's hands·

Yet the frail vessels 01 1116 1101161’6 wheel

No treacherous draughts 01 66011116 conceal!
Fear the gemmed 3011161, and suspicions hold
The ruby juice that glows in cups 01 gold!
