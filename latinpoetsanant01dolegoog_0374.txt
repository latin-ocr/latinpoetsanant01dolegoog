MARCUS ANNAEUS LUCANUS.

LUcAN was born at Corduba, in southern Spain, 39 Am.
His father was a brother of the philosopher Seneca. His ·
father moved to Rome when he was a baby, and there
he received his training, which was the best that the
metropolis afforded. Cornutus the Stoic was one of his
teachers. His talents early developed, and even as a boy
he began to declaim his own verses with great applause.
When Nero ascended the throne, he was friendly to
Lucan, but as the emperor was also a composer of verses
there was rivalry between them. When the two entered
the same public contest and the prize was awarded to the
commoner‚ Nero forbade him to publish or recite any
more of his compositions. Lucan, angered by this act
of tyranny, entered into the conspiracy of Piso. The
plot was discovered. Lucan, by a promise of par-don, was
induced to turn state's evidence. He denounced his own

Δ mother and revealed the names of all the other conspir-

ators without reserve. His treachery was without ad-
vantage. He was ordered to commit suicide. Then his
Stoic training came to his aid. He opened his vein‘s and
died, declaiming some verses which he had once composed
descriptive of a wounded soldier similarly dying. This
was in the year 653 he was only twenty· -six. He wrote
many poems‚ but all that is left is his⁴ ‘Pharsalia,'' a
heroic poem in ten books, descriptive of the struggle be-
tween Caesar and Pompey. The tenth book is incomplete‚
and breaks off abruptly 1n the middle of the Alexandrian
war. The growth of Lucan’ s liberal sentiments may be
said to be recorded' 1n the progress of the poem. At first
he flatters Nem, but afterward he proclaims the blessings
of liberty and inveighs against tyranny in terms evi-
dently directed against the emperor. The work is uneven,
but has many fine passages Especially the speeches
attributed to Caesar, Pompey‚ and Cato employed Lucan’ s
best powers. Of Cato' s encomium on Pompey, Macaulay
said, ⁴⁴It is a pure gem of rhetoric without one flaw''
