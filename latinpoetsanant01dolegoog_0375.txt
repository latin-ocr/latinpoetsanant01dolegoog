POMPEY AND CAESA R. 351

Shelley, after reading the first four bookS,—the weakest
of all,—declared that the “ Pharsalia '' was “a poem of
wonderful genius and transcending Vergil.'' Macaulay
ranked the ¹author “among the most extraordinary men
that ever lived.'' Dante placed him with Homer, Hor-
ace, Ovid, and Vergil. Dean Merivale, after criticising
his lack of imagination and his vague and uncertain
philosophy, sayS, “His wit and cleverness, considering
his yearS, are preternatura13 the trumpet 1301103 of his
scorn of admiration, after more than thirty years' famil-
iarity, still thunder in my ears with startling intensity.''
Christopher Mai-lowe translated the first book of Lucan
into 3011010113 blank verse that strove to represent the
work line for line. It was published in 1600. Thirty-
one years later Sir Thomas May brought out a rimed
version, which, like the original, is extremely unequal.
A hundred years later, or thereaboutS, Nicholas Rowe,
the playwright, translated the “ Pharsalia '' 3 Pope said,
“It deserves more notice than it obtains.'' The latest
version is by Edward Ridley, published in 1896.

POMPEY AN D CAESAR.

Bo'm differed much. Pompey was struck in yearS,
And by long rest forgot to manage 311113,

And being popular, sought by liberal gifts

To gain the light unstable commons' love,

And joyed to hear his theatre's applause:

He lived secure, boasting his former (10οᾶ3,

Α11(1 thought his name sufficient to uphold him.
Like to a tall oak 111 3 finitful field,

Bearing old spoils and conquerors' 1110111111101113, ·
Who though 1113 1001 110 weak and his own weight
Keep him within 1110 ground, his arms all bare,
His body, not his boughs, send forth a shade3
Though every blast it nod and seem to fall,
When all the woods about stand bolt upright,
Yet he alone is held in reverence.

Caesar’s renown for war was less3 he 10311033,
Shaming to strive but where he d’id subdue3
When 110 01 hope provoked, heady 311(1 bold3

At all times charging home and making havoc3
