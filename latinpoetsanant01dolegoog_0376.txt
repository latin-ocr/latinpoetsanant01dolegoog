352 MARCUS ANNAEUS LUCANUS.

Urging his fortune, trusting in the godS‚
Destroying what withstood his proud desireS,

And glad when blood and ruin made him way:

So thu-nder, which the wind tears from the clouds, ’
With crack 01 riven air and hideous sound

Filling the world, leaps out and throws forth fire,
Affrights poor fearful men and blasts their eyes
With overthwarting flames, and raging shoots
Alongst the air, and, not resisting it,

Falls and returns and shivers where it lights.

Such humours stirred them up: but this war's seed

That laws were broke, tribunes with consuls strove,
Sale made 01 offices and people’s voices

Bought by themselves and sold, and every year
Frauds and corruption 111 1116 Field of Mars 3·

Hence interest and devouring usury sprang,

Faith’s breach and hence came war, 10 111081 111611 welcome.
Now Caesar overpast the snowy Alps:

His mind was troubled, and he aimed at war:

And coming 10 1116 ford of Rubicon,

At night in dreadful vision fearful Rome

Mourning appeared, whose hoary hairs were torn,
And on her turret-bearing head disperst,

And arms 311 naked3 who with broken sighs,
