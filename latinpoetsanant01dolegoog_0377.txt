POMPEY AND C'AESAR. 353

And staring, thus bespoke: — “What mean'st thou,
Caesar. Ῥ
Whither goes my standard? Romans if ye be,
And bear true 1133113, stay here. '' This spectacle
Struck Caesar' 3 113311 with fear3 his hair stood up,
And faintness 1111111113(1 1113 steps there on the brink.
He thus cried out: -- “Thou Thunderer that guard' st
Rome' s mighty walls, built on Tarpeian rock.
Ye Gods of Phrygia and Iulus' line,
Quirinus' rites and Latian Jove advanced
On Alba hill. Ο 1133131 flames! O Rome,
My thought’s sole goddeSS‚ aid mine enterprise!
I hate thee not, to thee my conquests stoop:
Caesar is thine‚ so please ,it thee, thy soldier!
He, he afflicts Rome that made me Rome's foe.''
This said, he, laying aside all lets 31 war,
Approacht the swelling stream with drum and ensign:
Like to a lion of 33313111 desert Afric,
Wh0, seeing hunters, pauseth till fell wrath
And kingly rage increase ; 111311, having whiskt
His tail athwart 1113 back, and crest heaved up, ·
With jaws wide-open ghastly 13311118 3111,
Α111311 1113 Moor's light J'avelin or his spear
Sticks in his side, yet 111113 upon the hunter.
In Summer—time the purple Rubicon',
Which 1331133 113111 3 3111311 spring, 13 11111 shallow,
And creeps along the vales, dividing just
The bounds of Italy from Cisalpine France.
But now the Winter's wrath and watery moon,
Being three days old, enforced the flood to swell‚
And frozen Alps thawed with revolving winds.
The thunder-hooft horse, in 3 crooked 11113,
To scape the violence of the 31133111, first waded3
Which being broke, the 1331 had easy passage.
As soon as Caesar got unto the passage bank
And bounds 31 Italy, “ Here, here,'' saith he,
“An end of peace3 here end polluted laws!
Hence leagues andi covenants. Fortune‚ 11133 Ι follow!
War and the Destinies shall try my cause.²
This said, the restless general through the dark,
Swifter 111311 111111313 thrown from Spanish 3111183,
Or darts which Parthians backward shoot, marcht on.
