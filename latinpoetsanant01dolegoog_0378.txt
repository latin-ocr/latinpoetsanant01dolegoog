354 MARCUS ANNAEUS LUCANUS.

FOREBODINGS OF WAR.

YE Gods, who lavish priceless gifts on men,

Nor care to guard them, see victorious Rome
Teeming with life, chief city of the world,

With ample walls that all mankind might hold,
To coming Oaesar left an easy prey!

The Roman soldier, when in foreign lands

Prest by the enemy, in narrow trench

And hurried mounds finds guard enough to make
His slumber safe3 but thou, imperial Rome,
Alone on rumour of advancing foes

And plunged the world in darkness, so that men
Despaired of day —like as he veiled his light
From that fell banquet which Mycenae saw.

The jaws of Etna were agape with ssame

That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell

In smoking stream upon th' Italian flank.
Then black Charybdis, from her boundless depth,
