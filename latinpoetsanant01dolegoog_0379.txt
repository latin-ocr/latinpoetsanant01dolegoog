FOREBODINGS OF WAR. 355

Threw up a gory sea. In piteous tones

Howled the wild dogs; the Vestal fire was snateht
From off the altar-3 and the flame that orowned
The Latin festival was split in twain,

As on the Theban pyre, in ancient days;

Earth tottered on its base: the mighty Alps

From off their summits 8110οκ 1110 01011101 snow.
In huge upheaval 000011 raised his waves

O'er Calpe's rook and Atlas’ hoary head.

The native gods 811οᾶ 10018, 01111 holy sweat

Dropt from the idols3 gifts in temples fell:

Foul birds defiled the day3 beasts left the. woods
And made their lair among the streets of Rome.
All this we hear3 11ογ 111010 : dumb oxen 811011ος
Μο1181018 were brought to birth and mothers shrieked
At their own offspring3 words of dire import
From Cumae's prophetess were noised abroad3
Bellona's priests with bleeding arms, and slaves
Of Cybele’s worship, with ensanguined 11011,
Howled chants of havoe and of woe 10 111011.

Α11118 0108111, and sounding in the pathless woods
Were heard strange voices ; spirits walkt 1110-0011111
Α1111 dead men's ashes muttered from the 11111.
Τ11080 who live near the walls desert their 11011108, -
For 101 with hissing serpents in her hair,

Waving in downward whirl 0 blazing pine,

A fiend patrols the town, like that which erst

At Thebes urged 011 Agave, or which hurled
Lycurgus' bolts, or that whieh as he 001110

From Hades seen, at haughty Juno's word,
Brought terror 10 1110 80111 of Hercules.

Trumpets like those that summon armies forth
Were heard 1000110108 111 1110 8110111 night:

And from the earth arising Sulla's ghost

Sang gloomy 0100108, 01111 by Anio’s wave

‘ All 11οᾶ 1110 homesteads‚ frighted by the shade

Of Marius waking from his broken tomb.
