THE ASTROLOGER’S 1900101100.

Fleuum, to whom

For knowledge of the secret depths 01 space
And laws harmonicus that guide the 91919,
Memphis could find no peer‚ then spake at large 2-
“ Either,” he said, “the world and countless orbs
Throughout the ages wander at their will;
Or, if the Fates control them, 11110 111139
Η9039 0’91 1119 city and o'er all mankind.
Shall Earth yawn open and engulf the towns ?
Shall scorching 11991 usurp the temperate air
And fields refuse their timely fruit ? The streams
Flow mixt ‘with poison ? In what plague, ye Gods,
In what destruction shall ye wreak your ire ⁸?
VVhate'er the truth, the days in which we live
Shall find 9 (10001 101 many. Had the star
Of baleful Saturn, frigid in the height,
Kindled his lurid fires, the sky had poured
Its 10119019 101111 99 10 Deucalion's time,
And whelmed the world 111 1191919. 01· 11 111011,
Ρ110911119, beside the Nemean lion fierce
Wert driving now thy chariot, flames should seize
The universe and set 1119 911 ablaze.
These are 91 peace-3 but Μ919, why 911 111011 bent
On kindling thus 1119 Scorpion, his tail
Portending evil and 1119 claws aflame. 9
Deep sunk 19 kindly Jupiter, and dull
Sweet Venus’ star, and rapid Mercury
Stays on his course: Mars only holds the sky 1
Why does Orion's sword too brightly shine ?
‚Why planets leave their paths and through the void
Thus journey on obscure ? 'T is war that 9011199,
Fierce, rabid war: the sword shall bear the 11119,
Confounding justice3 hateful crime usurp
The name of vii-3tue and the havoc spread
Through many 9 year. But why entreat the Gods. ‘7
The end Rome longs for and the final peace
Comes with a despot. Draw thou out thy chain
Of lengthening slaughter, and (for such thy fate)
Make good thy liberty through civil war!

The frightened people heard, and as they heard
