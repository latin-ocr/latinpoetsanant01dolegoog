POMPE Y’s DREAM. 357

His words prophetie made them fear the more.

But worse remained; for as on Pindus, slopes

Possest with fury from the Theban Go'd

Speeds some Β6661161116, 111113 111 Roman streets

Behold a matron run, wh0‚ in her tranoe,

Relieves her bosom of the god within: -—
“Where dost thou snateh me, Paean, to what shore

Through airy regions borne ? I see the snows

Of Thracian mountains ; and Philippi's plains

Lie broad beneath. But why these battle-lineS,

No foe to vanquish — Rome on either hand ⁸?

Again Ι wander 'neath the rosy hues

That paint thine eastern skies‚ where regal N 116

Meets with 1113 flowing wave the rising tide.

· Known to mine eyes that mutilated trunk

That lies upon the sand. Aoross the seas

By ohanging whirlpools to 1116 burning elimes

· Of Libya borne, again 1 366 1116 110313

From Thracia brought by Fate' s command. And now

Thou bear' st me o’ er the cloud· compelling Alps

And Pyrenean summits; next to Rome.

There in mid-Senate see the olosing 366116

Of this foul war in foulest murder done.

Again the faotions rise3 through all the world

, 01166 more I pass; but give me some new land,

Some other region, PhoebuS, to behold,

Washt by the Pontio bissows, for these eyes
Already 01166 have seen Philippi’s plains.'’ ⁴
The frenzy left her and she speeehless fell.

POMPEY' S DREAM.

NE’ER to the summons of the Eternal laws
More slowly Titan rose, nor drave his steedS,
Foroed by the sky revolving, up the heaven
With gloomier presage3 wishing to endure
The pangs of ravisht light and dark eclipse3
And drew the mists up, not to seed his flameS,
But lest his light upon Thessalian earth
