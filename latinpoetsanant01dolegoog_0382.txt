358 MARCUS ANNAEUS LUCANUS.

Might fall undimmed.
Pompeius on that morn,

To him the latest day 01 happy life,
In troubled sleep an empty dream conceived.
Far 111 1116 watches of the night he heard '
Innumerable Romans shout his name
Within his theatre 3 the benches vied .
To raise his 161116 61111 place him with the Gods;
As once in youth, when victory was won
O'er conquered tribes where swift Iberus flOWS‚
And where Sertorius' armies fought and fied,
The West subdued, with no less majesty
Than if the purple toga graced the car,
He sat triumphant in his pure white gown,
A Roman knight, and heard the Senate cheer.

To reap the latest fruit 01 such a love: '
Though sure 01 fate to come. Thou marchest 011

She conscious ever of her prayers 101 11166
Η66111 by the 610118, 1166111611 1101 1116 Fates decreed
Such evil destiny‚ that she should lose
The last sad solace of her Magnus' tomb.
Then young and old had blent their tears 101 11166,
Α1111 child unbidden3 women tore their hair
And struck their bosoms 68 101 Brutus dead.
But now no public woe shall greet thy death
As erst thy praise was heard: but men shall grieve
In silent sorrow, though the victor's voice
