CAESAR’S SPEECH BEFORE PHARSALIA. 359

Amid the clash of ar’ms proelaims thy fall;
Though incense smoke before the Thunderer's shrine
And shouts of welcome bid great Caesar hail.

CAESAR'S SPEECH BEFORE PHARSALIA.

YE conquerors of a world, my hope in all,
Prayed for so oft, the dawn of fight is come.

No more entreat the Gods z with sword in hand
Seize on our fates3 and Caesar in your deeds
This day is great or little. This the day

For which I hold since Rubicon was past

Your promise given: for this we flew to arms: .
For this deferred the triumphs we had won,

And which the foe refused: this gives you back
Your homes and kindred and the peaceful farm,
Your prize for years of service in the field.

And by the Fates' command this day shall prove
Whose quarrel juster: for defeat is guilt

To him on whom it falls. If in my cause

With fire and sword ye did your country wrong,
Strike for acquittal. Should another judge

This war, not Caesar, none were blameless found.
Not for my sake this battle, but for you,

To give you, soldiers‚ liberty and law

'Gainst all the world. Wishful myself for life ·
Apart from public cares and for the gown

That robes the private citizen, I refuse

To yield from office till the law allows

Your right in all things. On my shoulders rest
All blame: all power be yours. Nor deep the blood
Between yourselves and conquest. Grecian schools
Of exercise and wrestling send us here

Their chosen darlings to await your swords 3

And scarcely armed for war, a dissonant crowd
Barbarie, that will start to hear our trump,

Nay, their own elamour ! Not in civil strife
Your blows shall fall — the battle of to-day
Sweeps from the earth the enemies of Rome.
Dash through these cowards and their vaunted kings:
