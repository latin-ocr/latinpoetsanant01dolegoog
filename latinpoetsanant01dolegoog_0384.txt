360 MARCUS ANNAEUS LUCANUS,

One stroke of sword and all the world is yours!
Make plain to all men that the erowds who deokt
Pompeius' hundred pageants 800100 were fit

For one poor triumph. Shall Armenia 0010

Who leads her masters, or barbarian shed

0110 drop of blood to make Pompeius chief

O'er our Italia? Rome, 't is Rome they hate
And all her children3 yet they hate the most
Those whom they know. My 1010 18 111 1110 hands
Of you, mine own true soldiers, proved in all

The wars we fought in Gallia. When the sword
01 00011 01 you shall strike, I know the hand:
The javelin’s flight to me betrays the arm

That launeht it hurtling: and to-day once more

I see the faces 810111, 1110 11110010111118 01708,
Unfailing proofs of victory 10 001110.

Ε’011 now 1110 battle rushes on my sight3

Kings trodden down and seattered senators

Fill all the ensanguined plain, and peoples float
Unnumbered 011 1110 0111118011 11ᾶο 01 (100111.
Enough 01 words —I but delay the Fates;

And you who burn 10 dash into the fray,

Forgive the pause! Ι 1101111110 with the hopes
Thus finding utteranoe. Ι 110’01 have seen

The mighty Gods 80 11001·; 11118 111110 field

Alone dividing us; 111011 hands are full

Who, when 11118 war is done, shall have the power
O'er all· that peoples, all that kings enjoy

To shower it where I will. But has the pole
Been moved‚ or in 118 nightly course some 8101·
Turned baokwards, that such mighty deeds should pass
Here on Thessalian 001111 ⁸? To-day we reap

Think of the oross 11101 11110018 118, and the chain,
Limbs haokt asunder, Caesar's head displayed
Upon the rostra3 and that narrow field

Piled up with slaughter: for 11118 11081110 chief

Is savage Sulla's pupil. ’T is 101 you,

If conquered, that 1 gri‘eve: my lot 011011

Turn from the battle ere the 100 110 fied,
