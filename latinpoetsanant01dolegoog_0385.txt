Drawn down from heaven by the throes of Rome,
May he be conqueror who shall not draw
Against the vanquisht an inhuman sword,

Nor count it as a crime if men of Rome
Preferred another-’s standard to his own.
Pompeius' sword drank deep Italian blood
When cabined in yon space the brave man's arm
No more found room to strike. But yon, Ι pray,
Touch not the foe who turns him from the fight,
A fellow-citizen, a foe no more!

But while the gleaming weapons threaten still
Let no fond memories unnerve the arm,

No pious thought of father or of kin3

But full in face of brother or of sire,

Drive home the blade. Unless the slain be known,
Your foes account his slaughter as a crime;
Spare not our camp, but lay the rampart low
And fill the fosse with ruin3 not a man

But holds his post within the ranks to-day.

And yonder tents, deserted by the foe,

Shall give us shelter when the rout is done.

POMPEY’S SPEECH BEFORE PHARSALIA.

THE da
Your bravery demands, that final gild
Of civil war ye askt for, is at hand.
Put forth your strength, your a113 the sword to-day
Does its last work. One crowded hour is charged
With nations’ destinieS. Whoe'er of you
Longs for his land and home, his wife and child,
Seek them with sword. Here in mid battle—field,
The Gods place all at stake. Our better right
Bids us expect their favour3 they shall dip
Your brands in Caesar's blood, and thus shall give
Another sanction to the laws of Rome,
Our cause of battle. If for him were meant
An empire o'er the world, had they not put
An end to Magnus' life ? That Ι am chief
Of all these mingled peoples and of Rome
