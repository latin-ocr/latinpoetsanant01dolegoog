362 MARCUS ‘ANNAEUS LUCANUS.

Disproves an angry heaven. See here combined
All means of viotory. N oble men have sought
Unaskt the risks of war. Our soldiers boast
Anoestral statues. If to us were given

A Curius, if Camillus were returned

Or patriot Decius to devote his life,

Here would they take their stand. From farthest East·
All nations gathered, oities as the sand
Unnumbered, give their aid: a world complete
Serves 'neath our standard& North and South and all
Who have their being 'neath the starry vault,
Here meet in arms conjoined.· And shall we not .
Crush with our olosing wing this paltry foe ⁸?

Few shall find room to strike3 the rest with voioe
Must be content to aid3 for Oaesar’s ranks

Suffioe not for us. Think from Rome’s high walls
The matrons wateh you with their hair unbound3
Think that the Senate hoar, too old for πως,
With snowy looks outspread3 and Rome herself,
The world's high mistress, fearing now, alas!

A despot—-all exhort you to the fight.

Think that the people that is and that shall be
Joins in the prayer —— in freedom to be born,

In freedom die, their wish. If mid these vows
Be still found place for mine, with wife and child,
So far as Imperator may, I bend

Before you suppliant — unless this fight

Be won, behold me exile, your disgraoe,

My kinsman's soorn. From this, 't is yours to save.
Then save Ξ Nor in the latest stage of life,

Let Magnus be a slave!

CATO AT THE ORAGLE OF AMMON.

Wnu, Labienus, should I seeke to knowe ?
If I had rather dye in armes than bow
Unto a Lord; if life be nought at all?

No differ-enee betwixt long life and small?
If any force ean hurt men vertuous ⁶?

If fortune loose, when vertue doth oppose
