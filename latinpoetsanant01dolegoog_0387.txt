CLE OPA TRA ’S PA LA GE. 363

Her threats, if good desires be happinesse

And vertue grow not greater by successe ἱ)

Thus much we know, nor deeper 13611 1116 skill

Of Ammon teach. The gods are with us still3

And though their oracles should silent be,

Nought can we doe without the gods decree3

Nor heeds he voices; what was fit to know

The great Creator at our births did show.

Nor did he choose these barren sands to shew
(Hiding it heere) his trueth but to 6 few.

Is there a seate of God, save earth and 666,

Aire, heaven and vertue ⁶? Why for God should we
Seeke further ? What ere moves, what ere is scene
Is Jove. For oracles let doubtful men

Fearefull of future chances troubled be3

Sure death, not oracles ascertaine me,

The coward and the valiant man must fall,

This is enough for Jove to speake to all.

CLEOPATRA’S PALACE.

Fmsr uprose the hall
Like to 6 fane which this corrupted age
Could scarcely real-3 the lofty ceiling shone
With richest tracery, 1116 beams were bound
In golden coverings; no scant veneer
Lay on its waIIS, but built in solid blocks
Of marble‚ gleamed the palace. Agate stood
In sturdy columns, bearing up the roof3
Onyx and porphyry 011 1116 spacious floor
Were trodden 'neath the foot3 the mighty gates
Of Maroe's ebony throughout were formed,
No mere adornment3 ivory clothed the hall,
And fixt upon the doors with labour rare

. Shell of the tortoise gleamed, from Indian seas,

With frequent emeralds studded. Gems of price
And yellow jasper on the couches shone.

Lustrous the coverlets3 the major part

Dipt more than once within the vats of Tyro

Had drunk their juice: part feathered as with gold3
