CLEOPATRA’S PALA GE. 365

But noble vintage of Falernian growth

Which in few years in Meroe's vats had foamed
(For such the olime) to ripeneSS. On their brows
Chaplets were placed of roses ever young

With glisbening nard entwined3 and in their looks
Was cinnamon infused, not yet in air

Its fragranoe perisht‚ nor in foreign elimes3

And rich amomum from the neighbouring fields.
Thus Caesar learned the booty of a world

To lavish and his breast was shamed of war
Waged with his son-in-law for meagre spoil.
